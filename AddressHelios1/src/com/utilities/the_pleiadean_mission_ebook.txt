Introduction 

 

Our civilization has gone through many important changes such as the 
discovery of fire, the development of the wheel, languages, religion, the 
industrial revolution, and technology, now we are moving into a New Age 
of mind and spirit. 

The next major event in history will be open contact with life forms from 
other worlds and taking our position in the family of man in the universe. 
This event has already started, but as in many historic changes, it is first 
known only to a few before it becomes known to the masses. The timing 
of this event is particularly important since our current civilization is in 
the beginnings of a transformation into a state of higher consciousness 
that will forever change the way we live on Earth. 

We have been contacted by humans from a small cluster of stars called 
the Pleiades. The inhabitants, the Pleiadians, are a race of people, not 
unlike ourselves, who have advanced thousands of years beyond us in 
technology and spiritual understanding. They are stimulating our 
consciousness through the dissemination of information so that we can 
make the necessary changes to create a new world based on Saalome, a 
Pleiadian word meaning "peace in wisdom," for the coming New Age on 
Earth. 


We are fortunate that these visitors from the Pleiades have chosen to 
gently awaken us to the knowledge of their existence. If they suddenly 
filled the skies with their spacecraft or landed on the White House lawn, 
the majority of the people of Earth would probably fall into panic and 
confusion. Others would worship them or expect them to bring us the 
long-awaited peace. Governments might fall or lose control as people 
began to think of themselves as citizens of Earth rather than of any 
particular country. Reactions would vary, but one thing is for sure—the 
Earth would never be the same because the knowledge that they bring 
about science, life, and philosophy could have a devastating effect on 
our social, economic, religious, and political structures. Too much 
information too fast could overwhelm a world that is used to making 
changes slowly. 

As our neighbors from another world come to visit, it can also be a 
wonderful time of discovery. There is the possibility to learn from them, 
change the way we live on Earth, and create real peace among men. 
Their knowledge can be used to enlighten our world so that we can 
resolve t e differences that separate us here on Earth and prepare us to 
fit in with the universal family of man on other worlds. Up to now, the 
many different races on Earth have been unsuccessfully trying to learn 
to live together and come to terms with their many different ideologies 
and social customs. Through contact with the Pleiadians, we are forced 
to examine ourselves through the revelations of a higher intelligence 
and, hopefully, move to a new level of awareness that can facilitate the 
peaceful coming together of the many nations on Earth. 

As we move out into the cosmos, we will come in contact with other 
races that live differently than we live; they may have mannerisms and 
customs we will not even understand. How exciting it would be to peer 


into the future fifty years from now and see all of the wonderful 
changes Earth will go through as we come into contact with beings from 
other worlds! The biggest event in our history is unfolding before us 
right now. 

When I became aware of our extraterrestrial visitors from the Pleiades, 
I traveled to Switzerland to the home of a Swiss farmer named Billy 
Meier, who was in contact with these off-world visitors. Over a three-
year period I made several trips to Switzerland to learn all I could 
about these contacts with extraterrestrial life. After I had become 
friends with Billy, he appointed me as his representative to speak at 
lecture halls in America and Europe on what I had learned. This gave 
me the opportunity to share the important messages of heightened 
spiritual awareness, our connection to the Universal Family of Man, the 
science of space travel, and the true origin of man on Earth through our 
connection to the Pleiades. 

After several years and hundreds of lectures, I am no longer his 
representative, but I would like to share with you what I have learned 
through studying the notes that Billy made of his contacts with the 
Pleiadians, as well as my own insights gained from private 
conversations with both Billy and other members of his group. Also 
included are my own ideas on how we can create a new future for our 
planet by using the knowledge of higher consciousness. This is not a 
book of UFO stories or fantasy, but a book of information based on the 
true life experiences of Billy Meier and the information passed on to him 
by the Pleiadians for the planet Earth. My intention is to educate, 
provide stimulating ideas, and raise awareness in order to help us 
adapt to the changes that are being instigated by our contacts with 
other forms of life. 


Each day it is necessary that we feed our bodies with food to nourish 
ourselves. It is also important that we feed the mind and spirit as well. 
Her I offer you food for your mind and spirit in the hope that we can all 
come together and create peace on Earth in the New Age. It is time for 
us to come together through education, not through the force of 
legislation. 

 

UFOs It is no longer a question Of whether or not they are real, 
But a question of whether or Not you know about them. 

 

A Prophet Comes to Earth 

Earth: 9500 B. C 

Earth was suffering from the most difficult of times. The great societies of 
Atlantis and Mu had lived in peace for over 20,000 years, and now 
treachery and deceit pitted brother against brother. Everywhere were the 
cries of war and hatred. Soon the oceans would boil with blood as the great 
scientists readied their weapons of destruction and violence. The peace at 
had long been their friend was fading to a memory as history was about to 
erase all traces of these two great civilizations. 

Far away on the home planets of the Pleiades, the great spiritual leaders 
watched and listened as their younger brothers on Earth quarreled. The 
highly developed sense of Pleiadian consciousness moved across time and 
space and felt the coming tides of death and destruction. Earth would be 
falling into a dark time which would last for many thousands of year -a 
time of despair, destruction, and degeneration-as those who would survive 
would be living on a planet with no spiritual guidance. It would be 
thousands of years before another civilization would again grow out of this 


hard and difficult period. 

A decision was made to help the people of Earth by sending them a special 
being of higher consciousness to serve as a prophet. This being would be 
much older and wiser than the people of Earth, having already lived 
through the difficult times of material evolution, which provide it with the 
great insights of life that would be needed to nourish the souls of men. The 
spirit, or soul, of this prophet had to possess the integrity and strength of 
character to teach the truth in the face of all opposition hate, anger, and 
doubt that would be directed at it, since the truth can sometimes be hard 
for people to accept. This was not an easy task for a normal person, so the 
Pleiadian spiritual leaders had to choose a very special spirit who could see 
beyond the cries of anger and ignorance of the uneducated Earthman, and 
still be able to offer love and guidance. 

In order to find this special spirit, the wise High Council of the Pleiades 
knew it would be necessary to search for a spirit who had evolved beyond 
the bounds of material life and existed in pure spiritual, nonmaterial form. 
It was known to the Pleiadians that the spirit, or soul, of all human beings 
eventually evolves beyond the material and becomes a purely spiritual 
form, which no longer requires a material body to survive. Having 
accumulated vast knowledge of the material life, the human spirit is then 
well-suited to helping younger and less-educated spirits who are still in 
material form. Even at this point evolution will continue, and the spiritual 
form will continue to learn and evolve until it becomes part of a larger, 
more highly evolved form of spirit called a collective consciousness. To the 
Pleiadians the word spirit, or spirit-form, means the same as our use of the 
word soul, and refers to the eternal life force energy that lives forever. The 
home planets of the Pleiades were not inhabited by such highly evolved 
beings, so the search began on other worlds. 


 

Human life is a spirit-form that has emerged from the Eternal 
Creational Spirit and has developed its own consciousness. It is 
still connected to the Creational Source and progresses through a 
series of material lives in order to evolve. 

 

A ship was sent to a remote area of the galaxy to a small planet called 
Lahson. Here on this quiet world lived a race of beings that through 
millions of years of evolution had evolved into a spiritual race, no longer 
having any need for the material bodies they once knew. Their knowledge 
of the material existence was complete and had freed them from the 
boundaries of the life-and-death cycle, for they now existed in the state of 
development common to higher life forms called a collective consciousness. 
Each one of these collective groups was comprised of seven different spirit-
forms. Each of these spirit-forms still retained some measure of memory of 
their individual personalities, but they could think and exist as a single unit 
while sharing their collective wisdom. 

Here on this peaceful and tranquil world, the Pleiadians made contact with 
one of these collective consciousnesses that was sympathetic to the 
problems of man. As the wise, old spiritual collective consciousness 
listened, one of its seven spirit-forms volunteered to degenerate back into 
material life and help the people of Earth. This was a very serious decision, 
for once the spirit returned to material life, it would lose contact with its 
memories and the accumulated wisdom that it had earned over billions of 
years of evolution. Once back in the material realm, it would be up to the 
Pleiadians to educate and help the old spirit reconnect with its vast 
knowledge in order to perform its important role in this special Mission. 


In order to get the old spirit to Earth, it was necessary to move it into a 
material body for the trip. The Pleiadians had brought with them a small 
child, who had been born especially for this Mission, to serve as host for 
the old spirit's journey. Since material bodies can be inhabited by more 
than one spirit at a time, it was easy for the highly advanced, old spirit to 
move itself into the Pleiadian child and once again feel the sensation of 
interacting with the world through physical means. Now separated from the 
highly evolved collective consciousness, the old spirit was ready to begin a 
mission on Earth that would last for 12,000 years; then, through the aid of 
the Pleiadians, it would return to Lahson and to the life it once knew. Once 
the mission was over, it would have to relive many lifetimes in order to 
evolve back to the level of evolution it was leaving behind. Many of the 
lessons of life that had been painstakingly learned would have to be 
learned all over again. 

With the small child carrying the ancient and highly developed spirit the 
Pleiadian ship quickly left for Earth. Having more than one spirit in a body 
at a time normally causes confusion, but the child was very young and 
would only have to support the visiting spirit for a short trip. Once on Earth 
the old spirit removed itself from the child and prepared itself for its first 
incarnation into a material life. The small Pleiadian child passed over to the 
other side or heaven as we call it, so its spirit-form could then incarnate 
into life on Earth. The wise, old spirit was also on the other side and 
prepared for its mission on Earth. 

The Pleiadians' spiritual knowledge makes it possible for them to contact 
the other side, the place where sleeping spirit-forms cogitate the 
experiences of the past material life and prepare for a new material 
existence. Once they are ready to reenter the material world and continue 
their path of growth and learning, Creation, the Eternal Spiritual Energy, 


provides an opportunity to return to the material realm through the 
process we call birth. Normally this is a natural occurrence involving both 
the spirit-form, who signals its readiness to return, and Creation, which 
makes it possible. When we are born, we begin to create the material body 
that we will live in. This material matter is called coarse-matter (energy in 
a solid state) by the Pleiadians and is created in relation to the spiritual 
evolution of the spirit-form that is creating it. The level of evolution of the 
mother and the father who begin the process of creating the body is most 
important since the spirit-form does not enter the body until it is already 
started by the mother, it is important to the incoming spirit-form to find a 
body to enter that is as close as possible to the same level of evolution as 
itself. This is one of the prime laws of Creation, which controls this process. 

In the case of the old spirit-form this would be impossible, for the level of 
evolution on Earth was far too underdeveloped compared to its own 
evolution. This first lifetime would be most difficult and awkward, for there 
would be a great loss in memory and intelligence as it degenerated into a 
material body not capable of holding its vast knowledge. This new Earth 
body would not have enough brain connectors and sensors to hold all of 
the incoming experience and wisdom; much would be lost. There would be 
no turning back once it entered this material body, because its connection 
to the vast wisdom of the collective consciousness on Lahson would no 
longer be available. Here on Earth it would be disconnected from much of 
its own evolution and would need the help of the Pleiadian spiritual leaders 
for guidance on this mission. 

After preparation and observation, the first material life of the great spirit-
form began on Earth. During this physical life, it would be known as a 
prophet in a world that was spiritually stagnant. Even though disconnected 
from the memories and knowledge of the previous lives on Lahson, the 


high evolution of the spiritual self that would remain intact would enable it 
to quickly adjust and learn the knowledge needed to help the people of 
Earth. Once born into its new material body, the spiritual memories would 
have to be opened up by the Pleiadian spiritual leaders in order to allow 
access to the knowledge of Creation and to some of the memories of its 
former lives. The knowledge of how to access spiritual wisdom was known 
to only a few on Earth, so it was up to the Pleiadians to help the old spirit-
form. In each lifetime it would once again be made aware of its spiritual 
identity and role in the Pleiadian Mission. The old spirit-form would be 
awakened to the wisdom that rested within its spiritual self, so it could be 
used during the material life. This being would also be given the 
opportunity to return to Lahson at any time, if it so desired. This would be 
the process through all of its lifetimes on Earth for the next 12,000 years. 

Lifetime after lifetime the Pleiadians helped the old spirit-form through 
various material lives in order to bring truth to the people of Earth. The life 
of a prophet is always difficult, for he/she bears the burden of upholding 
the words of truth to those who are usually afraid to hear it. To the 
Pleiadians, the people of Earth were learning the lessons of life very slowly 
and making their lives unnecessarily difficult. This seemed to be happening 
because misleading information about the meaning of life, causing people 
to live very material and unrewarding existence. 

Thousands of years passed as man continued on his slow path of evolution. 
The old spirit-form was procreated by the Pleiadians on several occasions 
to lead the life of a prophet, while very slowly the people of Earth were 
responding and learning the lessons of life. In some incarnations the old 
spirit-form would dedicate the entire lifetime to teaching just one message 
which would have such an impact that the world would change forever. 
Such was the case during the 16th century when the old spirit-form came 


into life for the sole purpose of educating the world about Earth's place in 
the universe. It was a time when the church dominated the thinking of 
man and interpreted the Bible as saying the Earth was the center of the 
universe; it was God's chosen planet and the sun and all of the other 
planets revolved around it. The church leaders also believed that the stars 
in the heavens were made of different materials than that of the Earth. 
They had created a position of power for themselves which was enslaving 
the minds of men. 


The Time of Galileo 

The Pleiadian spiritual leaders concentrated their highly skilled 
consciousness into the other side, and the sleeping spirit-form was again 
pulled into life. The year was 1564 in the town of Pisa, Italy, where on 
February 15th a new lifetime began in the name of Galileo Galilei. His 
father, Vincenzio Galilei, taught music and wrote books speaking out 
against the prevailing numerical theories of harmony. 

Galileo became educated in medicine and mathematics and became a 
university professor. He was well-known in the scientific community of Italy 
and was on speaking terms with the highest minds of the day, including a 
friendship with the Pope. His position in the community and his status as a 
learned man prepared him for the role he would play in the changing of 
history. 

It was in the year 1597 that Galileo read a book on the Copernican theory 
of astronomy, which removed the Earth from its traditional stationary 
position at the center of the universe and treated it as a planet that rotated 
on its axis daily. Copernicus also went on to postulate that the Earth 
revolved around the sun. This was in direct opposition to the church, which 


insisted that the Earth was the center of the universe and was made up of 
different material than the heavens that revolved around it. 

Galileo agreed with Copernicus, that the Earth was revolving, because it 
helped him explain ideas he was working on, such as the tides and their 
phenomena on Earth. In 1615 he went to Rome and argued publicly for the 
ideas of Copernicus. This action angered the Pope, who immediately 
appointed a commission to examine the theory of the Earth's motion. The 
findings of the commission were that the Copernican theory was contrary 
to the Bible and possibly heretical. The Pope was very angry at this 
attempt to undermine the authority and power of the church and ordered 
Galileo to never speak or write on the Copernican theory again. He was 
also forbidden to speak of it or teach it to anyone else. 

Galileo returned to Florence and turned his work toward astronomy and the 
telescope. He had made his voice heard to the public, and the seeds were 
planted. Although the Pope had crushed his efforts to enlighten the 
scientific community, Galileo had opened up the minds of those who had 
listened to him, thereby starting the slow breakup of church domination 
over science. 

In 1624 Galileo visited Rome again because his old friend, Maffi Barberini, 
was elected Pope and had taken the name Urban VIII. He asked the Pope 
to rescind the edict of 1616, which banned the work of Copernicus. Urban 
would not do this, but did give Galileo permission to write a new book 
comparing the old and new theories of astronomy, provided that the 
information in the book would be treated hypothetically. 

Encouraged by this small breakthrough, Galileo returned home and began 
work on the new book, which he called The Dialogue Concerning the Two 
Chief World Systems. It took several years to finish the work, and it was 


published in 1632. The book became another attack on the church's idea 
that the Earth is composed of a totally different kind of matter from that 
the heavens. Galileo reconciled the Earth's motion with man's experience in 
everyday life. He set forth the concept of the relativity of motion, inertia, 
and the notion of composition of independent motions. The Dialogue 
basically rejected current astronomy and physics and most of the 
prevailing philosophy. 

The book was printed with the church's authority, and Galileo felt he had 
truly made some progress against the old world thinking. However, within 
five months time the church changed its position on his book and called 
Galileo to Rome to explain himself. His old friend, the Pope, was no longer 
friendly; he became outraged that Galileo was continuing to undermine the 
authority of the church and trying to change the thinking that they had 
postulated. 

Galileo was ordered to stand trial, and although he fought gallantly, he lost 
to the unreasoning Pope, who would not listen to his arguments and 
sentenced him to life imprisonment. All copies of The Dialogue were 
ordered to be burned, and all universities were forbidden to read or sell 
any of Galileo's books. The church was outraged and was not ready to 
release it hold over the minds of men. 

Galileo's sentence was quickly commuted to house arrest, and he was put 
under the responsibility of the Archbishop of Sierna. He was later allowed 
to return to his home at Arcetri in the hills above Florence. At first he was 
crushed and did not know what to do with himself. But he soon found 
solace in being allowed to write on noncontroversial physics. Not willing to 
give up and give in to the church, Galileo smuggled The Dialogue out of 
Italy, and it was eventually printed in Latin and English. The book was re-
titled and called Discourses and Mathematical Demonstrations Relating to 


Two New Sciences. 

Galileo died at home on January 8th, 1642. His life's work of defending the 
right of science and breaking down the unreasonable attitudes of church 
had been successful. History would be forever changed, and is bravery 
gave hope to others, who began to challenge the close-mind authority of 
the church and discover for themselves the truth about man's position in 
the universe. The old spirit-form had done well. 

 

The Long Struggle of Mankind 

Just as the Pleiadian spiritual leaders had foreseen, it had taken thousands 
of years for the people of Earth to once again rebuild their great civilization 
and regain their technology. Years of extraterrestrial intervention by many 
visiting races had created a world mixed with spirit-forms from many 
different worlds. Most planets that develop human life have, by nature, 
only one race that evolves at much the same pace, so the process of 
developing a peaceful society comes easily. But here on Earth normal 
evolution has been interrupted by human beings (spirit-forms) that have 
come from many parts of the galaxy, creating a planet of mixed colors, 
sizes, and levels of evolution. It is not surprising that we have so many 
problems here on Earth, considering our world is such a mixture of people 
of different spiritual ages. Instead of being a planet where most people are 
of the same approximate spiritual age and are learning the same lessons of 
life at about the same time, we are a world mixed with young and old 
spirits, who all need different knowledge and have diverse backgrounds 
and spiritual memories. Most of the population of Earth came from the 
constellation Lyra, while others have come from the Vega section of the 
sky, the Barnard star, and some from star systems called Sirius and Orion. 


This has created a spiritual imbalance that has made Earth a world 
dominated by prejudice, hate, and anger. 

More than 11,000 years have passed since the inception of the Pleiadian 
Mission and the arrival of the old spirit-form from Lahson. He has died 
many lifetimes in order to gently guide us towards a better understanding 
of ourselves. The Pleiadians have watched over the development of our 
society and are still with us today, hoping that we can overcome the 
problems of our mixed heritage, and instead, use this rich diversity to our 
advantage. 

 

The Pleiadian Mission 

 

Even though the Mission to Earth had begun many years before, it was in 
the late 1600’s when more than 250 Pleiadians came to Earth to observe 
our growth. They built an underground base in Switzerland to conceal their 
presence. Often they would walk among us, but in most cases they would 
observe us from the safety of their underground facility or gather 
information from their sophisticated flying Beamships. Unmanned craft 
called telemeter ships were used to monitor our languages and thought 
patterns. There were many lessons to be learned about the diverse 
cultures that were evolving here on Earth. 

The Pleiadians and their ancient ancestors, called Lyrans, have been aware 
of our planet for more than 22 million years, but this was the first time that 
they had come to Earth to observe and become involved with us. They 
could have come at any time, but it was clear to them that our civilization 
was beginning to develop and that an important time as coming which 
would lead to great change here on Earth. 

Having much greater knowledge of the universe than we do, the Pleiadians 


are aware that our planet is physically moving into a position where it will 
be greatly influenced by energies from the huge central sun of the galaxy. 
This happens because our solar system moves in a large or it which brings 
us into this position every 25,860 years. This position that we are moving 
into causes our planet to pass through fields of energies generated by this 
powerful central sun; the effect is felt by the planet Earth and all life forms 
on it. Since few Earth scientists or religious leaders have any idea how 
these energies affect our thinking, it is fortunate our Pleiadian ancestors 
have decided to educate us. 

This position we are moving into is known to some as The Age of Aquarius, 
the spiritual era, the era of effective truth, enlightenment, love of 
knowledge, freedom, wisdom, and harmony. Unfortunately, all of these 
lessons will be earned through very difficult struggles. The Age of Aquarius 
will last 2,155 years, the same as the other constellations, and is repeated 
every 25,860 Earth years. As we move into this new time, we will have a 
window of opportunity for 800 years to achieve peace through spiritual 
growth and the understanding of Creation. If we miss this opportunity to 
bring a more peaceful and spiritual way of life to our civilization, then e 
probability rapidly increases that we will fall into a deep and dark period 
controlled by illogical thinking and negativity. Historically, civilizations 
typically last for around 10,000 years. Ours is about 8,000 years old and is 
moving into its most difficult phase. 

This time of change, or New Age, will be seen by spiritual people significant 
time of clarity, growth, and opportunity. However, the great mass of 
humanity is so caught up in the material struggle for life that they will 
perceive this as a time of despair, sorrow, and misery, because the mind- 
set of the industrial age fails to provide the wisdom necessary to lead Earth 
into a New Age of mind and spirit. 


 

A wonderful opportunity awaits those who have the vision to see 
the possibilities for peace and love on Earth. 

The beginning of the Age of Aquarius was on February 3, 1844 at 11:20 
a.m. Previously the Earth was in the Age of Pisces, and then moved into 
the transition period between the two eras. The complete time for 
transition from Pisces to Aquarius is 186 years; therefore, at the beginning 
of the year 1937 the last vibrations of the Age of Pisces were overcome. 
The Aquarian began developing rapidly in its second phase of transition on 
February 1937 at 11:20 a.m. In the year 2030 the transition time will be 
complete, and our solar system will be suspended in and bathed with the 
gold-colored rays of the sign of Aquarius. Then after another 1,969 years, 
the ext constellation era of Cosmic Age will arrive. This will be on February 
3, 3999 at 11:20 a.m., as our solar system moves into the area of the star 
sign of Capricorn. 

To the Pleiadians, with their vast knowledge of the energies of the universe 
and the effects they have on the consciousness of man, it was most 
important that they take this opportunity to lead man towards a new way 
of life-a path of spiritual understanding and harmony for the future. It is 
time for us, the people of Earth, to use our higher consciousness to sense 
the incoming energies and, adjust to them, for the effects of these 
powerful energies cannot be underestimated or taken lightly. 

To begin with, it should be made very clear that the Age of Aquarius is not 
a time heralding the imminent destruction of the world, but the 
acceleration of spiritual awareness. Some religions and prophets have 
incorrectly interpreted the Age of Aquarius as the end of the world. This is 
quite inaccurate, for it will not be the end of the world, but the end of era 


of ignorance and the beginning of a new time of enlightenment and 
awareness. It will also be a wonderful and exciting time of new inventions, 
the development of mind and spirit, and increasing contact with other life 
in the universe. The coming rapid changes and discoveries in technology 
will alter the way we perceive life and the Earth with which we live.

Because of the increase in energy from the central sun, the natural rate of 
development of our society is accelerating rapidly. Think of all of the 
wonderful inventions and changes we have already been exposed to in the 
past 100 years. We have come out of the age of the covered wagons, 
progressed through the industrialization of most of the world, and are 
moving out into space. Truly, we have made more advancements in the 
last 100 years than in the past 8,000. It is a most stimulating and 
challenging time to be alive. 

Spiritual people will see this as a great time of opportunity, for the increase 
in energy will accelerate personal growth and enlightenment. It is time for 


truth and understanding to find their way into our hearts and minds, and it 
is a time for us to discover new ideas and ways of thinking that will lead us 
into a new period of peace and understanding. We will discover our 
spiritual connection to Creation and no longer have any need for 
misleading religious doctrines. 

It is a good time for prophets, teachers, and light workers. Because of the 
surge of energy that occurred on February 3, 1937 at 11:20 a.m., the 
Pleiadians believe that those with the most leadership potential for the New 
Age were born on the first day of the changeover into the sign of Aquarius. 
Most of these spirits are among the oldest spirits on the Earth plane and 
will most likely work in unseen ways, as they have no need for public 
acclaim. 

Many others were born during that year and will be among the teachers 
and leaders of this new period for Earth. This increase in the energies of 
higher consciousness on Earth is also helpful to the spirit-forms on the 
other side, for it speeds up the turnaround time for them to return to 
physical life. Normally, the average turnaround time for a spirit-form to 
return to material life is 152 years. During this present time of energy 
increase, the turnaround time can be as short as 15 years. It also 
facilitates the birth of much more highly evolved spirits to come into 
material life. 

The majority of people will see this as a period of chaos, and will have a 
very difficult time adjusting to the speed of the changes and to all of the, 
new events that will be happening so quickly. One unfortunate part of 
these rapidly changing times is that many people will not be able to cope 
with the turmoil, and they will turn more and more to man-made belief 
systems and misleading religious doctrines for help, instead of seizing the 
opportunities to take responsibility for themselves. Spiritually conscious 


leaders will need patience, understanding, and mental balance in order to 
provide strength, love, and the appropriate role-modeling. The basic 
teachings of religion, the Ten Commandments, provide the basis for a 
good, honest life; however, the problem lies with religious leaders who 
claim to be the mediators of God who provide the passageway to the 
doorway of heaven. As the coming times become more chaotic, you can 
expect many new religious sects to spring up that will take advantage of 
people's fear and lack of knowledge. 

Man must face up to being 100% responsible for his actions and 
his spiritual growth, for there is no God or other divine beings that 
will do it for him. 

A friend of mine once mentioned that there is a line being drawn in the 
sand of awareness. On one side we have the more enlightened and 
spiritual people who see the coming New Age as a time of opportunity, 
leader ship, and growth. And on the other side, we have the people who 
are not even aware of what is going on. As you look around and observe, 
you can see that this is true. Most people are consumed with personal 
problems an live in spiritual ignorance, contributing nothing to the growth 
of our society or Creation, while others are trying to learn, understand, and 
grow during this wonderful time. 

Knowing the effects that the Age of Aquarius energy will have on us and 
understanding the difficulties that face us as a civilization, the Pleiadians 
have chosen to help us with knowledge and understanding that can help us 
grow and evolve on the right path. They have built another underground 
base under Russia in order to become more involved in the development of 
Earth mankind. After years of careful analysis of our thoughts and studying 
the actions of our world leaders, they have decided that we need the words 
of truth in several areas to help us move peacefully into our future. 


 

What Is the Meaning of Our Lives? 

The Pleiadians feel that the most important information they can help us 
with surrounds the meaning and purpose of our lives. Probably no greater 
question mystifies the people of Earth more than this, and at some point in 
all of our lives we stop to reflect on the purpose of our existence. To those 
on a spiritual path, it seems almost pointless to be alive if we do not 
understand why we are living, while those living in a more material world 
seldom stop to even ask the question. 

It is the objective of religions and belief systems to offer an answer to this 
question. However, if you travel around the world, you can find as many 
answers as there are countries, for almost every religion and belief system 
has a different explanation as to why we are alive. Quite obviously, they 
cannot all be correct. As the world draws closer together through 
technology and communication, there seems to be an inevitable clash or 
gridlock approaching, whereupon the many answers to this question come 
face to face and can no longer avoid each other as they have in the past. 

From the view of the Pleiadians, they see us as a confused civilization that 
has turned to death and destruction too many times. In their eyes, the 
misleading explanations of some religions as to the meaning of our lives 
has served to keep people in the dark, causing confusion, wars, and 
bloodshed for thousands of years. There has been no greater loss of life on 
Earth then that caused by religious wars and persecution. The element of 
fear has been used all too often to control people and to prevent them 
from the personal discovery that is possible for anyone - the discovery of 
Creation and its infinite logic which guides all things in the universe. 

The spiritual man who has set aside his ego to travel through the realms of 


consciousness can find the answer to life for himself. Here, Creation can be 
discovered, and the spiritual bonding of all life forms can be felt. The 
understanding of the infinite spiritual energy can be realized, and the 
awareness of the purpose of the material consciousness becomes easier to 
see. For once spiritual existence is understood, the reason for material life 
becomes clear. 

We are spiritual beings, living through a series of material lives in order to 
feed our spirits through the wisdom learned from the material existence. It 
is the process of how spiritual development takes place and how we, 
individual spirit-forms, contribute to the whole of Creation and its 
evolution. 

The spirit needs the material senses to gather information and to form 
logic from experience. If the wisdom learned from these experiences is true 
according to Creation and becomes part of the life of the individual, then it 
passes into the realm of the spirit and becomes part of the accumulated 
knowledge of the spirit-form. This is what spiritual evolution is and why we 
are alive. 

Our technical advancements far outweigh our social development, 
and represent a clear and present danger to our future. 

 

Science of the Universe 

During the past 300 years of Pleiadian observation, it has become clear 
that we are not developing fast enough socially to handle our technical 
growth with responsibility. A lot of scientific effort has been put into the 
development of war machines, but how about the science of the mind and 
spirit? Scientists are continually looking for the answers to how things 
work. Beginning with the simplest question and probing the greatest 


mysteries, man is always searching for the explanation of how the universe 
came about and how we fit into it. Seldom does the scientist offer any 
spiritual conclusions to his quest for knowledge, for only the more material 
or tangible answers are acceptable. 

At some point, though, the use of formulas and calculations will have to 
give way to the more spiritual aspects of the universe. To be able to 
explain the mysteries of the universe, we will need a better understanding 
of the Creational Spiritual Energy that created it. Man will have to blend 
together the conclusions learned from questions asked by material science 
with the knowledge of spirit in order to solve the puzzle, for ultimately the 
answer to the science of the universe is the explanation of the spiritual 
power at guides it. Scientists and spiritual leaders, then, are on the same 
path, but approaching on different roads. 

Creation is the spiritual power that guides the universe. It is Creation that 
has the idea to create a universe. Once that idea is formed, it becomes 
reality in the form of a small existence of energy that contains information 
on how to begin a universe. That idea is always connected to the 
Creational power that started it and can never be separated. It is through 
this connection that Creation serves as a constant guide of how to evolve. 
A universe can be described as a material life form that is going through its 
own development and evolution in order to supply wisdom to the Creation 
that started it. 

It is the Creation which lays out the blueprint for the universe to follow. 
The Creation itself is evolving through a process of discovery which is 
learned from experience that is provided by a material universe. Creation 
has an awake period, during which it creates a material universe for 
learning, and then a sleep period, where there is no material existence. It 
then reawakens and starts the cycle over again at a higher evolution. It is 


this pattern which permeates all things and provides the explanation for 
how all life forms evolve. Since all life forms must evolve according to the 
patterns set by the Creation, it is the understanding of the evolution of 
Creation through the development of spirit which is most important to the 
people of Earth. 

 As the Pleiadians lay concealed in their underground laboratories watching 
the growth of our society, the problem of how they could best be of help to 
Earth without taking responsibility for us had always been a problem. 
Trying to find a way to help without interfering with our right of free ill was 
difficult, especially in the area of spiritual education. Finding ways to 
enlighten us on the use of mind and spirit without being detected or 
controlling our thoughts challenged the morality by which they live, for the 
Pleiadians are bound by their own laws of noninterference in our political or 
power structures, and must rely on disseminating information fed through 
prophets and other enlightened beings. 

Nowhere in the Western world is there any public educational process that 
helps us understand how to use the many different levels of mind and 
consciousness to control our lives and our evolution. Depending on where 
you are brought up and what kinds of schools you attend, you will probably 
be taught nothing more than how to read and write, and then be tossed 
into the working world to stand in line and fend for yourselves. 

 

Most of the problems of the world are caused by illogical thinking. 

 

Misery, depression, heartache, and other forms of emotional illness are all 
caused by thinking in illogical ways. Imagine how we could change the 
thinking of the world if we had a logical process by which we could 


understand how our minds work with information, how it is stored and 
used by our material consciousness, and how to use the spiritual powers 
that are in all of us to keep our thoughts in balance. This kind of teaching 
should be present in our educational system. 

There is a logical way for anyone to learn about the many different levels 
of consciousness and how the inner workings of our minds use information. 
Through meditation we can learn simple exercises to help us understand 
and control our thinking. We can learn to gain access to powers of spirit 
that connect us to realms of higher thinking and knowledge. Most 
importantly, we can learn the balance of mind and spirit that is so 
necessary to make life enjoyable and fruitful. 

It is generally accepted that life is hard and difficult. This is not true. Once 
the individual learns to control his thinking and use his spirit day-to-day 
life, all problems seem to vanish like the rain in sunshine. Luck is a self-
inflicted state of mind, caused by doing the right thing for the right reason 
while in a balanced state of mind. The process of maintaining the state of 
mind that produces luck in life can be learned and used by anyone. Once 
the balance of spirit and material is understood and the ego is under 
control, the human can live a rich life of continued happiness. 

 

The History of Man on Earth 

Another part of the Pleiadian Mission is to educate us about the history of 
man on Earth. Our written history is very short and incomplete and 
provides little information about the origin of our civilization. It seems very 
unlikely that the many different races of Earth all naturally evolved here, 
yet we have no practical or scientific explanation of our existence here on 
Earth. Why are the Asians, Caucasians, Arabs, American Indians, and 


African all so different? It doesn't seem possible that we all could have 
evolved from the monkeys. The differences between us have provoked 
prejudice and wars for thousands of years, and now that our weapons are 
getting more devastating, so it's more important than ever that we learn to 
understand each other and come together as one people, the people of 
Earth. 

The Pleiadians tell us that it has been 626 billion years since the formation 
of the gas ball that eventually became the planet Earth. Most of that time 
has been spent evolving spiritual energy into a physical world at can 
sustain life. However, it has only been during the past 400 to 500 million 
years that human life on Earth has been detected. Modem science believes 
that Homo Sapiens (wise man) first appeared around the Mediterranean 
about 500,000 years ago, and it's only been in the last 6,000 years or so 
that details of any kind have been recorded. Our current civilization has 
been but a brief period in the long history of Earth, possibly nothing more 
than the last second in a yearlong life span. 

Anthropologists look for the explanation of our history on Earth through the 
study of plants, bones, artifacts, and relics left by earlier times. But the 
discovery of the origin of man is still a mystery left unsolved, for all of the 
pieces cannot be found. The cutting edge of knowledge continues to 
change as we learn more and more about our stay here on Earth. 

What is missing is the understanding of how life started on Earth, and how 
it has been manipulated and tampered and experimented with for many 
millions of years. Through the Pleiadians we will discover how ancient 
travelers from many different worlds have come to Earth and settled here. 
At last we will know how the many different colors, sizes, and races on 
Earth can be found in the history of the colonies that have settled on Earth 
over the past several million years. Most important are the colonization’s 


during past 100,000 years. 

The Pleiadians have studied all the languages ever spoken on Earth or 
millions of years. They have records of the many different colonies that 
were founded here and blended together to make the very unique mixture 
of today's Earthman. We have not been left alone to evolve on our own as 
most planets have, but instead we are a mixture of many different races 
that have come here over the millennia. It is this mixture of races that are 
all at different spiritual levels of evolution that has led to the difficult times 
we are now experiencing. Most planets have only one race; therefore, they 
have fewer problems. Many war-like races have come here and contributed 
to our family tree and our bloody history. 

 

The Unsolved Mysteries on Earth 

The unrecorded period of the history of Earth has left behind a myriad of 
unexplained mysteries on our planet such as the pyramids, Easter Island, 
the ancient lines of Nazca, and many other unsolved riddles that are 
connected to our past. The explanations of these mysteries supplied by the 
Pleiadians will provide an understanding of man and how we came to be 
here. Once we can see ourselves within the rich history of our past, we will 
form a new view of our planet as men of Earth, instead of hundreds of 
independent countries fighting against each other for power and control. 

The Pleiadians tell us that their forefathers were our forefathers. We are 
both descendants of a race of people called Lyrans, who have populated 
Earth on many occasions. It is because of this common ancestry that they 
see us as distant family and are trying to help us. Through a better 
understanding of our origins and how we have all come together, we can 
put together the pieces of our unique humanity, for we are about to move 


out into the universe and join up with the family of man that awaits us. 

 

Contacting the Minds of Men 

It is not clear as to how far the Pleiadians will go to interfere in our growth. 
The fact that they interfere at all gives us some level of insight into their 
moral values. They have admitted that about 100 years ago they 
enlightened some of us Earthlings in order to cause certain inventions to 
manifest that they felt were needed. As to what these inventions were, we 
are not certain, but the method they use to transfer ideas is quite 
interesting. 

The Pleiadians see the people of Earth as an insane society, 
rushing headlong to its own destruction, a destruction that can 
only be averted by a change in mass consciousness. 

 

They broadcast ideas, visions, thoughts, etc., at levels of consciousness 
that can be picked up by our subconscious as we sleep. These ideas 
become part of our dreams, and then we wake up with a great idea, having 
no awareness of its origin. This way the Pleiadians do not feel they are 
interfering with our right of free will, for many people may pick up the 
ideas but only a few will act upon them, using their own initiative. In no 
case do they allow anyone to realize the origin of the thoughts, for that 
would interfere with our right to create our own future. 

They want us to be responsible for our own actions and to make decisions 
based on our own initiative. They have learned the hard way that it is 
better to conceal themselves and not let their presence be detected, since 
in the past when they did this on Earth and on other worlds, it did not work 
out well. They were sometimes revered as gods, feared as invaders, or 


found themselves in charge of a planet of helpless people who wanted to 
be cared for. Since none of these scenarios serve their interests, they have 
taken a very low profile on Earth at this time and have tried to remain as 
undetected as possible. 

Around the turn of the twentieth century, a decision was made to start 
physical contact with someone on Earth. This had been tried several times 
before, but in most cases the person selected lacked sincerity and was not 
useful to the Mission. The purpose was to see how humanity on Earth 
would react to the idea that they were not alone in the universe. They had 
studied the thoughts of people all over the planet, but were not sure how 
most of the population would react to the thought of life on other worlds. 

For the most part, very few people at that time had given the idea of life 
on other worlds much consideration. Life was hard, and most of their 
thoughts and energies were geared toward survival and taking care of 
themselves and their families. It was quite obvious that, with very few 
exceptions, nothing was known about the real meaning of life or spiritual 
growth. The decision was made to contact someone on Earth who would 
carry the message to the world that they were not alone. 

We are not told the name of the lady chosen by the Pleiadians for this 
Mission. This is just as well, since the plan did not work out. She was 
drawn into several physical contacts with the Pleiadians and educated 
about other life forms throughout the galaxy and the development of life 
on Earth. She was asked to go public with the information to let people 
know what she had learned. Unfortunately, this experiment did not work 
out well; her first attempts brought ridicule by her friends and family, and 
she was considered crazy. She quickly gave up the idea of speaking about 
her contacts out of fear for her life and her position in the community. 
People were not ready to open their minds to information that challenged 


the viewpoints of the powerful religions which completely dominated their 
thinking. It was quickly learned that the people of Earth were too insecure 
in their spiritual development to take responsibility for themselves; they 
found it easier to cling to myths, or folk stories of gods who would take 
care of them, providing an excuse for the many difficulties and problems in 
life. It seemed to be easier to say, "That's the way God wants it," or "It's 
God's will," than to take responsibility for one's own decisions, mistakes, 
achievements, and doubts. The Pleiadians realized we were not ready, so 
they stopped the contacts and pulled back again into a position of 
observation. They didn't understand us as well as they had thought. 


The Birth of Eduard Albert Meier 

It wasn't until the 1930s that once again the idea of physical contact with 
Earth was considered. Because of the change that humanity would be 
going through in the coming New Age of Aquarius, it was becoming even 
more important that the people of Earth be awakened to the truth about 
the meaning of life. Earth was spiritually stagnant and controlled by men of 
power and greed who caused wars to make money, placing the attainment 
of power and control over others above all else. Indeed, mankind was 
heading toward some hard lessons, and not only was not catching on but 
was becoming more like sheep, with no power to resist the forces of 
darkness and illogical thinking that ruled the planet. 

The time was 1937, and a decision was made to search the other side for a 
spirit-form that would have the ability to carry the message to Earth, and 
who would try to break down the barriers of illogical thinking and spiritual 
darkness that plagued mankind. The highly advanced spiritual 
consciousness of the Pleiadians moved into the realm of the other side and 
found the old spirit-form from Lahson, bringing it back into life to once 


again serve as a prophet to the people of Earth and provide the knowledge 
to awaken the spirit of man. 

It happened on February 3rd, 1937 at 11:00 a.m. in Bulach, Switzerland. 
The spirit-form from Lahson was born into the material world and was 
named Eduard Albert Meier by his parents, who were simple farmers living 
by the land and the word of God. It had taken the control and thinking of 
seven powerful spiritual leaders of the Pleiades to cause this event. Earth 
now had a new prophet. 

Born at 11:20 a.m., just 20 minutes later, were three more spirits who 
might be helpful with the Mission. They were also born in Europe and 
would live close to Eduard, so they would be able to help him in his mission 
if he needed it. The plan was for Eduard to be the physical contact, and the 
others would be contacted telepathically for the purpose of aiding Eduard 
through the many difficult times that lie ahead. Not much is known about 
these people, except that two of them have died in a car accident. The 
third person has chosen to remain anonymous. 

It was hoped that the knowledge the Pleiadians would impart to Earth 
through the new prophet would help man to better understand himself and 
rise to new levels of consciousness. The current civilization on Earth had 
long lived in a self-contained sphere of ignorance, cut off from the 
knowledge of their ancestry and the spiritual teachings of Creation. This 
would be the most important time in their history, for Earthlings would be 
gently awakened to the idea that they were not the only thinking human 
beings in the universe. It was a time of awakening for the people of Earth 
because they were about to rejoin the universal family of man after years 
of darkness, ignorance, and spiritual stagnation. It was a time of The 
Pleiadian Mission. 


Contact from the Pleiades 

As Creation moved to allow the procreation of the old spirit-form into the 
world as Eduard Meier, the unseen hand of Pleiadian consciousness gently 
guided the newborn infant into life. He would be watched over and cared for 
from that day forward. The importance of this new lifetime could not be 
understated, for the Pleiadians were aware of the difficult times to come in 
the New Age. Through this new prophet they would see to it that the 
wisdom of thousands of years of accumulated lifetimes would find its way 
into the hearts and minds of the people of Earth. 

Of the seven Pleiadians who helped guide the old spirit-form into the world, 
one, an elderly man named Sfath, decided to take on the task of watching 
over young Eduard and seeing to his education. In each lifetime that the old 
spirit-form had served as a prophet, it was necessary in the early years of 
material life to awaken his sleeping spiritual memories and bring forth the 
wisdom and abilities that would be needed to perform his missing. In this 
lifetime it would be Sfath's job to connect with the spirit-form who had 
become Eduard and prepare him for the tasks ahead. 

Sfath began to listen to young Eduard's thoughts, which were just 
developing, but had no plans to make any contact with him for several 
years. However, at the age of six months, Eduard suddenly developed a 
case of pneumonia that seemed quite serious. For several days Sfath 
carefully observed Eduard's health, which rapidly became very critical. His 
mother called in the family doctor. After a short examination, he informed 
Mrs. Meier that young Eduard was in a coma and would probably not make 
it through the night. After the doctor left the house and Eduard was left 
alone in his room, Sfath decided to take matters into his own hands. 
Without the knowledge of Eduard's parents, Sfath came into the bedroom 
and reversed the disease. By morning Eduard's health had returned. Mrs. 


Meier believed that her prayers had been answered and that a miracle had 
saved her baby. She would never know her home had been paid a visit by a 
kindly old man from another world. 

It wasn't until Eduard was five years old that Sfath decided to open contact 
with the child by stimulating his mind. At first simple thoughts and ideas 
were telepathically sent to Eduard, challenging him to try to understand 
their meaning and to respond. This was Sfath's way of getting Eduard 
to use his mind and wake up his old memories. It was easy enough to 
contact the spiritual side of Eduard, but the material consciousness 
was not yet trained in how to use its spiritual self, so the telepathic 
thoughts went largely unanswered and uncomprehended. 

Two years passed as Eduard continued to receive thoughts from Sfath 
without really understanding their meaning. He did not have the 
knowledge to comprehend the significance of the strange visions that 
had been flowing into his head. Sfath had been monitoring Eduard's 
thoughts and decided that now it was time to open up the spiritual 
side of Eduard, bringing forth the old memories and knowledge that 
would help him interpret the meaning of his transmissions. To do this, 
Sfath sent the telepathic command to Eduard to walk out into the 
forest near his home and to wait for him. Eduard had become 
accustomed to the telepathic voice by now and was not alarmed or 
intimidated, so he simply obeyed and went out into the woods and 
waited. 

Sfath was high above the Earth in his spaceship and could sense t at 
Eduard was responding to his request and was now waiting in the 
forest. The Pleiadian spacecraft was locked on to Eduard's brain 
patterns, and quickly darted down into the atmosphere of Earth and 
headed for Switzerland. Eduard looked up and saw a small silver dot in 


the sky. It suddenly streaked toward him like a flash of light and 
quickly appeared on the ground as a pear-shaped craft. It was unlike 
anything he had seen before. The craft had arrived quickly, without 
making a sound, and gently set down in the meadow where Eduard was 
waiting. From inside the ship Sfath had carefully scanned the area to 
make sure that there was no one else around before stepping out of 
the craft. 

Eduard seemed very calm for a young boy of seven and followed Sfath 
into his spaceship as he was directed. Within a few seconds the craft 
left the Earth and was over 40 miles up in orbit. There was no feeling 
of motion, so Eduard had no idea where he was until he looked out a 
window and saw the Earth far below. Sfath was expecting that a short 
ride in a Pleiadian craft would jar loose some old memories in Eduard's 
mind, causing him to search himself for their meaning. Sfath wanted 
him to discover for himself that he had lived many previous lives, 
during which he had ridden in a similar spacecraft. 

Sfath said not a word, but observed Eduard's thoughts as the craft 
quickly returned to Earth and quietly settled back down on the ground. 
Eduard was still speechless and seemed to be deep in thought. He had 
not said a word during the entire trip. Sfath was content with the 
experience and knew that Eduard's mind would be very busy making 
some old connections. Eduard turned to look at Sfath's ship; it had 
vanished just as suddenly and silently as it had appeared. Eduard was 
suddenly left alone in the forest to walk home with a lot of new ideas 
in his head. These ideas would take some time to sort out. 

Over the next two years Sfath began to send telepathic messages 
more frequently, and Eduard began to respond and offer answers to 
the many questions posed to him. He was beginning to remember 


many things and make some connections, but there was a lot he didn't 
understand yet. Sfath could tell that Eduard's mind was ready and 
once again directed him to a meeting place at a remote spot in the 
forest. This meeting would be different, for it was time to open up 
Eduard's mind and let him know about his mission. He would have to 
decide for himself if he wished to continue or stop, for Sfath would not 
coerce him into a stressful lifetime as a prophet. In order for Eduard 
to make an intelligent decision, Sfath would first have to provide 
explanations and educate him in many ways. 

Once Eduard was aboard the spacecraft and they were safely up in 
orbit above the Earth where nothing could disturb them, Sfath began 
to explain to Eduard that he would have to prepare himself for a very 
serious and extremely important mission. He would have to decide for 
himself whether or not he would bear the burden of this mission for 
which he had been born. 

After many explanations, Sfath placed a device on Eduard's head 
which made a direct contact with his mind and unlocked many old 
memories and knowledge. More importantly, he brought forward the 
awareness of the language of spirit that is deep within us all. This 
language of spirit is a language of signs and symbols with which one 
can interpret the meaning of telepathic messages that are sent to the 
spiritual side of oneself. This immediately allowed Eduard to 
understand the meaning of some of the transmissions he had received 
from Sfath. Within minutes, his understanding of himself and his 
mission became much clearer. At this point he made the decision to 
commit to his part of the Mission. 

Happy that Eduard had responded so favorably, Sfath returned him to 
Earth. Eduard now had the mental capacity of a 35-year-old man and 


would be able to understand the complex concepts of science and 
mind that he would now receive telepathically from Sfath. He also 
possessed spiritual awareness and knowledge far exceeding that of 
anyone else on Earth. The device that was placed around his head 
while he had been on the ship had opened up his spiritual self and 
rekindled much of the old spirits accumulated wisdom that dwelled 
deep within his mind. Everything was in place now for Eduard to learn 
and develop into the prophet of his time. After several more years of 
telepathic education from Sfath and other extraterrestrials, Eduard 
was told he would now be left alone for 11 year to mature and 
contemplate what he had learned. He would need some time for 
himself—to travel, to meet his mate, to start a family, and then settle 
down—before the Pleiadians would revive the contacts. It was during 
these years that he lost his left arm in a bus accident in Iskenderun, 
Turkey on the 3rd of August, 1965. This was an important event in his 
life as it had been foretold to him by the extraterrestrials 7 years 
prior it’s happening. Billy marks this event as part of his spiritual 
development and carry's his left arm like a badge of honor. 

It was 1965, and the 250 Pleiadians who lived and worked in the vast 
underground complex under Switzerland had taken relatively little 
interest in the development of young Eduard that had been left up to 
Sfath. They had been busy with their normal duties of monitoring the 
thoughts of Earth's leaders and studying the effects of the New Age on 
mass consciousness. Now it was time to choose someone to give 
Eduard special attention, and prepare for the series of physical 
contacts that would be necessary to educate him as a prophet. 

Semjase Prepares for Her Mission 

A Pleiadian woman named Semjase volunteered to take on the mission 


of being Eduard's teacher. She had never been on Earth and was not 
part of the underground complex team that had been observing Earth 
for the past 310 years. She was fascinated by the idea of working with 
the people of Earth. For her it meant that she would have to learn a 
great deal about the planet, its history, science, languages, its people 
and, of course, Eduard Meier. 

Semjase lived on Erra, the home planet of the Pleiades, where the 
level of consciousness was quite different from that of Earth, where 
she would soon be spending so much time. This would pose some 
problems for her, so she set about her task of preparation slowly. 
First, she studied the German language that was spoken by Eduard. 
The information storage systems available to her in the Pleiades had 
on file the King's German that as spoken on Earth during the 16th and 
17th century. This was very similar to the Swiss German that was 
spoken by Eduard and would allow her to understand his thoughts 
once she began to monitor them. 

For the next ten years, she studied the history of Earth and its people 
over the past several million years so that she could educate Eduard. 
She would occasionally listen in on his thinking so she would be better 
prepared to communicate with him when the time came. Throughout 
all of this time Eduard was unaware that she was listening to this 
thoughts or that she was studying him. 

During this time Eduard had taken on the nickname of "Billy," a name 
he had picked up while watching American movies about Billy the Kid. 
Very fond of American Westerns, Eduard thought of himself as a 
cowboy, and thus became "Billy." He wore a cowboy hat and often 
carried a gun and holster just like his movie heroes, Gene Autry and 
Roy Rogers. 


In order to understand more about his fellow man and to learn about 
the many philosophies of life, Billy left Switzerland and traveled to the 
East to continue his education. As the years went by, he continued his 
travels through many countries, including India, Pakistan, and Greece, 
where he met and married a Greek woman named Kaliope, who went 
by the nickname of Popi. They returned to Switzerland, to the town of 
Hinwel, to start their family. Employed as a night watchman, Billy used 
his time alone to study the many lessons of life that he had learned 
over the years in preparation for his mission. He practiced meditation 
constantly in order to gain access to the spheres of higher 
consciousness. Sfath had made many references to the previous lives 
that had been lived by Billy's spirit, encouraging him to find out about 
them for himself. Through meditation it was possible for him to connect 
with his spiritual self, the doorway to the memories of former lifetimes 
and the lessons learned. Billy was very puzzled by the idea that he had 
lived previous lives as a prophet serving the Pleiadian Mission, and 
gave much thought to unraveling this mystery. 


Billy's First Contact with Semjase 

Semjase was comfortable with her mission and the knowledge she had 
acquired and felt she was ready to start the contacts. Just before 
leaving for Earth, she spent a few days practicing with a language 
specialist to brush up on the King's German, and then she was ready. 

It was on Tuesday, the 28th of January, 1975 at 1:00 p.m. Earth time, 
when Semjase sent her telepathic message to Billy. He was working at 
home with his tape recorder, trying to capture the voice of spirits. He 
had been trying for months, with poor results, when her thoughts 
suddenly came into his mind. She was directing him to get his camera 


and meet her at a remote spot to which she would lead him. 

She could tell by his thoughts that he was surprised. They didn't know 
each other yet, for she had not introduced herself or made her 
presence known to him during the years she had studied him. Part of 
his surprise was that he was not expecting contact for another year, 
but the thoughts in his head made it quite clear he was being led into a 
remote area for a meeting with a visitor from another world. 

As the silver spacecraft floated high above Earth in the clear Swiss sky, 
she continued to send telepathic messages to Billy, guiding him into the 
remote forest area. He had driven through a small village and, within 
minutes, was heading into a local forest. As he rode his small moped 
along the lonely road, he once again felt the thoughts of Semjase come 
into his mind and guide him to move on down the road to a more 
remote location. Looking at his watch, he noticed it was 2:12 p.m. and 
that he had been driving for a full hour. 


Contact from the Pleiades 

In her telepathic messages Semjase suggested that Billy bring his 
camera, for she was going to allow photos to be taken of her 
spacecraft as proof of her existence. It had been decided by the 
Pleiadian council that the main purpose of the first visits would be to 
provide evidence of their existence; it was time to awaken the people 
of Earth to the idea that they were not alone. In the past they had 
made contact with other Earth people for the purpose of making their 
presence known, but had not allowed any photos to be taken. At that 
time they were concerned that this would have been taking the proof 
of their existence too far, causing undue mental stress on some 


people. They had to be careful of the manner in which they exposed 
themselves to the masses of Earth, and it was clear to them after 
years of study that the minds of most Earth people at that time were 
too fragile to handle the idea of visitors from another world. Now, 
however, they felt the time was right to allow photos of the craft to 
gentle awaken us to the idea that we are not alone in the universe. 

From out of the clouds Semjase guided her ship and hurried toward 
the meeting place in the quiet meadow in the Swiss countryside. Even 
though the ship was very quiet and flew noiselessly, Billy noticed the 
rustle of the birds and wildlife that signaled the approach of an alien 
energy to the forest. He parked his moped by a tree and stood 
motionless as the sleek, silvery craft set down in the remote meadow. 

As soon as the UFO had landed, Billy walked toward it to observe it 
more closely and to get a better photograph. But about 100 meters 
before reaching the UFO, he was stopped by some unseen force. It felt 
like he was pushing against the winds of a completely soundless 
storm. With all his power he tried to fight against the energy field to 
move forward, but he could only advance a few feet because the 
counteracting force was simply too great. Billy decided to sit down on 
the ground, stare at the spaceship, and wait for the occupant to come 
out. 

Semjase could tell that Billy was mentally calm and was prepare to 
greet her, so she opened the hatch to her spacecraft and stepped out 
onto the ground. As she walked toward him, she could tell his thoughts 
were all about her appearance. Billy was thinking that her clothes were 
rather familiar —a cosmic suit, similar in form to some Earthly 
products, but very pliant and light, he analyzed. Actually, the suit was 
more like an overall with a peculiar gray color. Very close up it 


reminded him of the skin of an elephant, which he had seen once in 
Africa and again in a zoo in Switzerland. The suit fit tightly to the body 
and appeared to be quite durable. Around her neck was a metal ring, 
apparently for the purpose of fastening a helmet of some type. 
Evidently the Earth's atmosphere was suitable for her, for she never 
required a helmet during her visits to Billy. 

As people tend to do, Billy was quickly looking her over and forming his 
opinion of her. Her head was exposed and she was easily recognized as 
being a young woman. The look on her face was free and open; with 
nothing to suggest that she was superhuman or carried a superior 
attitude. Her manner was that of a normal-looking human being who just 
happened to be of extraterrestrial origin. Billy could not ignore the fact 
that she was also very beautiful. Her walk was that of a normal person, 
only stronger and mere self-assured. Her long, red hair shone in the 
sunlight as she stopped in front of him. 

Slowly she extended her hand to Billy, seized him by the arm, and pull-d 
him up on his feet. Her grip was strong and sure, but very pleasant a d 
confident. They walked toward Billy's motorbike where they both just -at 
down in the dry grass. Then she began to speak, not in his home 
language of Swiss German, but in the older King's German that she had 
learned. This caused her to have an accent that was peculiar to him, but 
he had no trouble understanding her. 

Semjase introduced herself, explaining that she was from a small cluster 
of stars called the Pleiades. She told him she had been listening to his 
thoughts for several years in preparation for this meeting and understood 
his character very well. She knew that Billy was a fearless man whose 
integrity could be counted on. For quite some time, she and her people 
had wanted to come in contact with an Earth human being who was 


sincere and really wanted to be helpful to their Mission. Many times 
before, the Pleiadians had tried physical contacts with humans, but the 
people chosen turned out to be unwilling, and also often lacked loyalty 
and sincerity. Some of those chosen feared for their safety and kept silent 
about their contacts, or were afraid that they would be thought of as 
insane by their friends and family. 

She told Billy to relax, that today she had information to impart and to 
only interrupt her if he did not understand something. She promised there 
would be more meetings in the future, and he could ask all the questions 
that he wanted. Today, for their first meeting, she simply wanted to 
introduce herself and let him know what to expect in the future. 

To begin with, she and her people were concerned that so many people 
here on Earth were claiming to be in contact with the Pleiadians and 
claiming to have ridden in their Beamships, as she called them. This 
simply was not true, for they had not conducted physical contacts with 
any Earth people for some time. The same held true for certain UFO 
organizations which had been trying to gain knowledge about their 
Beamships, but they had no photos that were really authentic. There are 
many photos in existence which appear to be extraterrestrial craft, but 
are really nothing more than blurred lights. Most of the photos, of which 
she was aware, were nothing more than fabricated deceptions 
manufactured by dishonest people seeking wealth and fame. 

Semjase wanted to make it clear to the people of Earth that her 
people had been coming to Earth for thousands of years and were not 
involved directly with the governments or political leaders. Only 
occasionally do they make contact with a chosen person such as Billy, 
and then it is only for the purpose of awakening people to the idea 
that they are not the only thinking, rational beings in the universe. 


Another point that she wanted to make clear was that she and her 
people were not superhuman and do not have supernatural powers. 
Laser beams do not shoot from their eyes, and they do not have the 
strength of ten Earthman. In truth, they are human beings just like the 
people of Earth, but their knowledge and wisdom is far greater, 
especially in the technical and spiritual areas. It is their highly 
developed spiritual knowledge that enables them to use certain powers 
of spirit that seem like magic to us, such as telepathy, telekinesis, and 
access to higher realms of consciousness. These abilities also lie within 
the Earthman, but they are not as well developed. 

We should also be made aware, Semjase warned Billy, that there are 
many deceitful people on Earth who pretend that they are in contact 
with human beings from other planets in our own solar system, and 
even claim to have flown in their spacecraft. This is not true, for the 
planets they talk about are so desolate that human life is impossible 
there. Other planets, in contrast, have been lifeless for a long time or 
are in the first stages of development and do not support life in any 
form. There is no human life in our solar system except here on Earth 
and a few scattered bases manned by the Pleiadians and other races. 

Other solar systems beyond ours do exist with various forms of life, 
and not exclusively human. There are also many animal and even 
plant life forms that have evolved to higher forms of life. It was time 
for the people of Earth to know that many life forms exist who have 
reached advanced knowledge and travel through the universe, 
sometimes visiting Earth. Many of these other-world travelers are 
malicious and should be considered very dangerous. The people of 
Earth should be on guard for these types, for they often fight and 
destroy everything that comes their way. Sometimes they will even 


destroy whole planets or civilizations and force the inhabitants into 
slavery. Part of her mission was to warn the Earth humans about 
these creatures, because the time rapidly approaches wherein a conflict 
with some of these beings will become unavoidable. 

Another part of her mission was directed toward our religions and the 
consequent sub development of the human spirit. In future meetings 
she wanted to spend some time in the education of spirit matters, so 
the people of Earth could learn about the one power that resides over 
the life and death of each creature. This is the Creation that dictates 
the logic by which he universe and all life forms exist. This logic is 
absolute and forms the laws by which man must live. These laws are 
apparent in nature, and reveal the knowledge of life and the direction 
towards spiritual greatness, which embodies the goal of life. It was time 
for the Earthman to learn about the true meaning of life and how to live 
in peace and harmony with nature and the eternal energy of Creation. 
This would be the subject of many of the future meetings. 

By studying the thoughts of Earth, the Pleiadians have also discovered 
that we are living under the wrong idea that Gods are equal to the 
Creation itself. We have also misled ourselves into believing that an 
Earth human being by the name of Jmmanuel was the son of God and 
the Lord of the Universe. In future contacts, Semjase would explain in 
detail the role of Gods within Creation and provide us with the real 
truth about the life and teachings of Jmmanuel, whom we call Jesus 
Christ. 

One further point in this area was that the Pleiadians and other 
extraterrestrial races have not come to Earth on behalf of a God to 
bring the Earth the long-awaited peace. Earth humans must learn that 
never can a God take the role of the Creation or control the destiny or 


fate of the human being. A God is simply a physical being, a governor, 
and, moreover, a human being who has evolved to a level of great 
understanding and knowledge through millions of lifetimes. Gaining 
power through his knowledge, these beings usually exercise control 
over their fellow creatures. Those that are significantly less developed 
will believe that these self-styled Gods have power over their lives, but 
they do not. Creation is the spiritual force that has the knowledge to 
create a universe, whereas a God is only a material being with 
knowledge of the human form and is subject to Creation like all other 
life forms. It was also not true that the Pleiadians came to Earth on 
behalf of any God, for they are no longer governed by Gods or rulers 
and now live completely free, enjoying their spiritual connection with 
Creation. 

The Creation itself never gives commands or demands worship in any 
fashion because it is an egoless, nonjudgmental spiritual force. It is 
eternal knowledge that guides the growth of the universe, and that 
knowledge is never in need of commands or religions. The Pleiadians 
would like to bring this truth to the light of the world and make it 
known to human beings. It is an important part of their Mission. If this 
does not happen, then it is possible that mankind will slowly destroy 
itself, or fall into complete spiritual darkness. 

Semjase then made it clear that there would be many more meetings, 
and she planned to spend a lot of time with Billy to pass on the 
information the Pleiadian Council felt was important for Earth. She had 
prepared for the coming contacts for several years, and had great hopes 
that the information she would provide would be useful in helping the people 
of Earth create a more peaceful future. Her objective today was only to 
introduce herself and let Billy know of her plans for the future. This would be 


all for their first meeting, and he could plan for her return within a week. 

She would contact him when she was coming, just as she did today. He 
would feel a cooling sensation on his forehead, followed by the telepathic 
transmission of thoughts that would let him know where to meet her. She 
would be careful to interrupt his thoughts only when he was open to it, and 
to not infringe on his privacy. 

Future contacts would be in her Beamship, so they would have some 
privacy. She also intended to take him on flights into free cosmic space, so 
he could visit the other planets and see the solar system. It was okay for 
him to bring his camera, for they wanted to encourage him to take many 
pictures and bring them to the attention of the public. She would be more 
helpful in the future, posing her ship so that he could get some very good 
shots. 

Bidding Billy farewell, Semjase then walked toward the spacecraft that was 
sitting there quietly in the meadow, disappeared inside of the craft, and flew 
away within seconds. Billy took advantage of the opportunity and snapped 
several more photos as the ship disappeared over the forest. He knew from 
previous experience that you had to be quick if you wanted to get good 
pictures of these spacecraft, because they changed directions so quickly and 
disappeared in seconds. 

Just as Semjase had said, she began to return almost every week. Each 
time she would send the telepathic message to Billy, guiding him to a 
remote spot where they would be unnoticed. Billy would ride his moped to 
where he was directed and wait for the silver craft to show up. On most 
occasions he would bring him up into her Beamship, especially since the 
Swiss weather can be so harsh most of the year. Here they could talk and 
have their meetings in private and she shared with him the vast amount of 


knowledge that the Pleiadians felt was important for Earth. 

After each meeting, or contact as Billy called them, he would return home 
and type out what was said. Not trusting Billy's memory, Semjase had 
arranged for a special computer-like device to replay to Billy's mind all that 
was said at the contact, so he could type it down exactly. The device could 
read the memory of the meeting that was stored in the subconscious mind 
of Semjase and send it to the conscious mind of Billy, who was sitting at his 
typewriter. He would then hear the conversation in his head and type it. This 
was particularly hard for Billy, having only one arm, and made the job of 
typing very difficult. During the transmissions from Semjase, he would sit at 
the typewriter and be capable of typing 50 to 60 words a minute without 
stopping. He would normally have someone sitting beside him to change 
the paper as the continuous stream of knowledge flowed from his mind 
out onto the typewriter keys. This process would usually last for 
several hours, until either the transmission was complete or he was 
exhausted. 

The amount of work became overwhelming to Billy. He was having a 
contact almost every week, and at the same time he was a father and 
husband who needed to provide for his family. His wife, Popi, had two 
kids, a house, and a husband to take care of, and she wasn't in the 
mood to hear that Billy was too busy having contacts with a nice-
looking woman from another planet and had no time to work. It was 
several months before she began to take his contacts seriously and 
started to understand their importance. 

At each contact he would usually get the opportunity to bring his 
camera and shoot two or three rolls of film. Semjase wanted Billy to 
get the best UFO shots ever taken as proof to the public that his 
meetings and information were real. She and the members of the High 


Council of the Pleiades, to whom she had to answer, felt that many 
people on Earth ware ready to take this step up in their consciousness. 
The pictures would be proof to some, and to others it would open up 
old memories of life on other worlds where ships such as these were 
common. She was well aware that there were many old Lyran spirits on 
Earth who had lived many lifetimes on other worlds far more advanced 
than here. 

Billy's pictures began to appear in magazines and newspapers in 
Switzerland and surrounding countries. They were all beautiful 
daytime photos that were very clear and distinct. They were so good 
that many people couldn't believe that they were real. But many of 
those who did believe came in droves to Billy's home in Hinwel. On 
Sundays the road to his house was packed with cars from all over, for 
everyone wanted to talk with the man who was in contact with the 
star people. Billy had made a promise to Semjase to tell everyone 
about his contacts and would refuse no one. He underestimated the 
scope of his promise, for people came by the thousands to ask their 
questions and look at his spectacular photos. His home life was ruined 
as people crawled through the windows, went through his drawer and 
stole his pictures, and made life miserable for himself and Popi. The 
local townspeople were getting fed up with all of the traffic and 
commotion. Most of the villagers didn't believe his story and thought he 
was some kind of con man who was making this up. They didn't think 
this was amusing at all and wanted him out of their town. It wasn't 
long before Billy was forced to look for a new place for himself and his 
family to live. 

Billy found a nice, old farm in a remote area of the country that 
Semjase pointed out would have a good chance of surviving the 


coming disasters around the turn of the century. On a viewing screen 
in her ship she showed Billy the areas of Switzerland that would be most 
affected by coming volcanoes, fires, and more importantly, the rising 
water that was expected from overflowing oceans. These events would be 
happening around the advent of the twenty-first century. The farm was in 
a safe place in a little rural area called Schmidruti, about 45 minutes east 
of Zurich. Here, Billy could live peacefully and continue his work safe from 
the coming natural disasters. 

Buying the farm was expensive, especially since Billy had no income other 
than the pension he received from the Swiss government. He would need 
some financial help from others in order to buy the farm. As luck would 
have it, an old friend came forward just at the right time and was able to 
offer enough money for a down payment on the farm, and things fell into 
place for him to move his family to their new home. 

Over that past year, many of those who had come to visit with him had 
expressed interest in helping him with his work of disseminating his 
informative Contact Notes to the public. So far, Billy had amassed over 
1,000 pages of Contact Notes he had written of his meetings with the off-
world visitors from the Pleiades. The information included was on many 
different subjects, from history to science to consciousness. Semjase had 
been prompting him for months to get his notes in order and to make 
them available to the public, and she was most adamant that Billy should 
speak in public. All of this was proving to be too much for Billy. He just 
couldn't keep up with the workload, and public speaking was very difficult 
for him. He had tried on a couple of occasions to speak to small groups in 
neighboring cities, but he was ridiculed and laughed at, and he wanted no 
part of it anymore. 

Once the move to the farm at Schmidruti had been accomplished, Billy 


decided to take Semjase's suggestion that he form a group around him 
that could help him with his work. They could help him with his Contact 
Notes and other books he was writing, and possibly public speaking. Billy 
approached some of his followers who were most anxious to help out with 
the work, and a group was formed. They called themselves the Freie-
Interessengemeinschaft fir Grenz-und Geisteswissenschafien and 
Ufologiestudien, a rather long German phrase which means "Free 
Community of Interest in Border and Spiritual Science and Ufology." If 
you don't speak German, this is difficult to learn, so to most of the world 
the group has become known as the F.I.G.U. There were 25 members in 
the original group, 15 of whom took up residence at the farm where Billy 
and Popi had just moved. In honor of the special purpose of this new 
home they would all share, they decided to name the farm the "The 
Semjase Silver Star Center." The F.I.G.U. members then began to take 
part in helping out around the "Star Center," or `"Center" as they called 
it, and took on special duties to help Billy with his writing. Some of the 
F.I.G.U. members helped edit his books, while others answered letters 
from around the world, and some took day jobs in town to help out with 
expenses. All in all life started to become easier for Billy, and The Semjase 
Silver Star Center was becoming well known around the world, and off. 

As the contacts continued and his pictures were shown in magazines and 
newspapers around the world, people everywhere became interested in 
the Swiss farmer who was in touch with the star people. His contacts 
continued for almost three years and produced hundreds of beautiful 
pictures, metal samples, biological samples, crystals, and stones from 
other planets. He was even allowed to take over 30 minutes of movie film 
of the Beamships in flight which was converted to video tape for the world 
to see. Here, at last, was the kind of proof of extraterrestrial contact that 


people were looking for. 

After 115 meetings, the Pleiadians did finally end the contacts on 
Thursday, October 19th, 1978, because they no longer served their 
interest, but the wave of excitement and intrigue was spreading around 
the world. Even though the contacts had ended for Billy, they were just 
starting for the people of Earth. 

During the final months of the contacts, an investigative team from 
America led by Colonel Wendelle Stevens began to publish the results of 
their findings. In a wonderful and informative book called UFO—Contact 
from the Pleiades, an Investigative Report, written by Colonel Stevens, he 
summarized over 10 months of intensive investigative work that included 
analysis of landing tracks and photos, testimony of witnesses, detailed 
study of each contact sight where Billy had taken his photos, and 
hundreds of hours of conversation covering the information about these 
beings from the Pleiades. It was a significant piece of work that captured 
the excitement and enthusiasm that surrounded Earth's most important 
contact with human life from another world in modern times. 

Other members of the investigative team, Lee and Britt Elders, combined 
their investigative findings with the beautiful, clear pictures taken by Billy 
and created an informative and stimulating photo journal called UFO—
Contact from the Pleiades. This very professional book stirred the 
emotions and provided deep insights into the thinking of these off-world 
visitors. I purchased the books and began to study them with great 
interest. The investigative report by Wendelle Stevens was fascinating 
and captured my attention for weeks, but I was strangely drawn to the 
photos of the Pleiadian Beamships in the photo journal and couldn't stop 
staring at them. "This book is important," I said to myself. I just knew it. 
As I slowly turned the pages, I became more and more certain that this 


book held some important truths about life from another world. I became 
obsessed with the book, and for days I could think of nothing else. 

The implications were very serious, indeed. Here, at last, could be proof 
of the existence of life on other worlds. And if this was true, then just 
think what we could learn! I had read every word in the book several 
times, especially the part that said Meier had the opportunity to have 
physical contacts with these visitors. They had taken him with them in 
their ships on many occasions for the specific purpose of educating him 
on a variety of subjects about life, the universe, religion, history, and 
science. The Pleadians even allowed him to ask questions put together 
by himself and a group of friends from the F.I.G.U., who also seemed to 
be involved in the contacts. The book answered some of my questions, 
but didn't go into very much detail. I was hungry for more, and found 
myself calling directory assistance in Arizona to find the publisher, find 
the printer, find someone; I had to know more. There was the ring of 
truth in this book that touched something deep inside of me. I was sure 
that someone out there was making an effort to get in touch with us. 

It took just a few calls to reach the Elders, who were located in a small 
town in Arizona. They had just returned from several months in 
Switzerland investigating this case. They were very helpful and 
answered a lot of my questions, offering some new insights into the 
experiences of Billy Meier that were not in their book. My phone bill was 
pretty high for awhile because I kept calling and asking more questions. 
It turned out that Billy had more than 115 meetings with these visitors 
from the Pleiades. He had compiled several books out of thousands of 
pages of notes taken during his many meetings with them. He was 
publishing his notes in a set of books called The Contact Notes, but the 
problem was that the books were all written in German and no English 


translation had been started yet, so I was cut off from the information. 

The investigators told me they had put Billy's photos through many 
different kinds of analysis and could find no evidence of a hoax of any 
kind. They had investigated other witnesses who had seen the ships, 
some of whom had also taken photos of the ships. They even had been 
to the sights where the photos were taken and reconstructed the photo 
scene for computer comparison. Small models of the Beamships were 
made and taken to the original contact sights where Billy took pictures 
with the same camera for comparison with his own photos. The shots of 
the models were then analyzed by computer and photographic experts 
who were able to detect the models in every case. Billy Meier was 
indeed taking pictures of some unknown type of craft that appeared to 
be from another world. 

Billy had given them metal samples for analysis that he had received 
from the Pleadians which was representative of the type of material 
that their ships were made of. These metal samples had been turned 
over to a scientist at IBM named Marcel Vogel, who proclaimed he could 
identify most of the ingredients of the metal, but not the manufacturing 
process. It was beyond our technology at the moment and clearly not of 
this Earth, because the metal would have to have been made in some sort 
of vacuum process. It seems the investigators were almost losing their 
own objectivity, and they were having trouble finding any reason to 
doubt Billy's claims. He truly seemed to be having contacts with human 
visitors from another world. 

Hardly a day went by during the next couple of years that Billy Meier’s 
experiences were not on my mind. I seemed to have awakened old 
thoughts and dreams from somewhere deep inside of me that wouldn't go 
away. I kept my UFO—Contact from the Pleiades photo journal out on the 


coffee table for guests to see. The book's cover was a beautiful shot of 
one of the flying Beamships just hovering over a grassy knoll with some 
logs nearby. The shot was so captivating that anyone seeing it couldn't 
resist opening the book and asking a few questions. I just had to talk 
about this with other people. I soon discovered that many people had the 
same kinds of questions about life that I had, and maybe here within the 
pages of this book some of the questions could be answered. But one 
book was not enough, I wanted to talk to Billy, read his notes, and learn 
more. I had traveled through China, most of the East, Europe, Egypt, 
Japan, and had made three trips to the Vatican City, putting together 
pieces of our humanity. My quest had led me down a lot of trails that 
always came to the same conclusion—we just don't know very much 
about life and how we fit into the workings of the universe. There was a 
different theory everywhere you went, all of them based on some truth, 
but usually summarized with a lot of guess work that brought me no 
closer to the answers that I was looking for. We were still confined to this 
planet with nothing but our own past experiences to guide us. History had 
left us on our own to create several thousand years of beliefs, religions, 
and cults, which always seemed to lead to war and bloodshed rather than 
enlightenment. I really had to learn more about this. It was time to go to 
Switzerland, time to visit the Semjase Silver Star Center and meet Billy. 

I finally made arrangements to visit Billy at his home in Switzerland. His 
letters said it would be okay for me to stay for the summer and learn all I 
could. His contacts had stopped and the crowds had died down, so it was 
a really good time to go. I had written to him and explained how I was 
very interested in the information from his Contact Notes that he had 
published in German, which I couldn't read, and would like to continue my 
education about his experiences. 


I had learned enough to frequently give public speeches and lectures 
about what little I knew about his experiences. But more importantly, I 
needed to know more for myself. My need to personally grow and 
understand myself better was driving me to Switzerland and to the home 
of Billy Meier. 

Since I owned my own business, I put all of my work on hold, packed my 
bags, and made arrangements to leave for Switzerland and the little 
rural area called Schmidruti. This was very exciting, and I felt sure 
that this was going to be a real time of enlightenment. Actually, I 
really had no idea of the immense amount of information that was 
waiting for me. The summer turned out to be a life changing 
experience. 

 

The History of Man 

During my stay at the Semjase Silver Star Center, my home was a small 
van parked behind the house with just enough room for myself and a very 
poor translation of Billy's Contact Notes in English. Someone had tried to 
translate them from German, but whoever it was did not speak English 
very well. The translation was word for word, as if someone had simply 
used a dictionary to look up all of the words without regard for grammar or 
sentence structure. This made the Contact Notes very hard to read, so I 
spent a lot of time trying to figure out what they said. 

The little van I was staying in was only a short walk from the main house 
and afforded me a little privacy, so I had a place to contemplate all that I 
was learning. I spent several hours each day going over the Contact 
Notes and then spent some time working around the farm and helping out 
since there was always some work to do, painting the garage or fixing a 


fence. My nights were normally filled with occupying some F.I.G.U. 
member's time with lots of questions, or reading and thinking. Usually in 
the afternoon I would spend some time with Billy, if he was up to it. He 
had a couch on the front porch where he liked to sit and enjoy the beautiful 
scenery that surrounded him. Just in front of the house he had built a small 
aviary that contained a few birds that would hop from branch to branch, 
chirping continuously as if they were very busy doing something. It was 
kind of hypnotic and tranquil to watch them playfully fly around the cage; 
often I would sit there with him feeling the serenity of nature and soaking 
up the warm summer of Switzerland. 

I was learning a great deal from Billy and the other F.I.G.U. members who 
lived at the Center. I had been reading my rather poor English version of 
Billy's Contact Notes that he had made during his meetings with Semjase, 
and I was trying to figure out the chronology of Earth history. 
Unfortunately the notes were hard to read, with fragments of history 
scattered throughout the 1,800 pages. In hopes that Billy had a more 
cohesive understanding of all of this data, I ask him to fill in some blanks 
for me, and I finally got a better picture of what had happened here on 
Earth during the past several hundred thousand years. 

 

The History of Man 

One of man's greatest mysteries is his origin. Where do we come 
from, and why are we here on Earth? The history of our current 
civilization has been recorded fairly well, so we have a pretty good 
idea of what has happened the past 6,000 years or so, at least as far 
as major events such as wars and religious occurrences. But if you 
wanted to get into a discussion about any possible life existing here 


before that time, you would be hard-pressed to find any tangible 
materials to back up your argument. 

In order to put together the pieces of our past, we have the writings of 
the Bible, which are widely accepted by many. We also have the 
Sanskrit scrolls, a collection of writings that date back to around 1200 
B.C. and contain the religious wisdom of the East. We also have the 
highly regarded Mayan calendar, a prophetic work that has accurately 
portrayed the future of man from 2,000 years ago up to a time in the 
future around the year 2050. And, of course, there are the Dead Sea 
Scrolls, a collection of ancient manuscripts discovered in 1947 in a 
series of caves on the west bank of the Dead Sea in the area of 
Jordan. These scrolls are Biblical religious texts written in Hebrew and 
Aramaic around 200 B.C. The Pleiadians regard the Dead Sea Scrolls, 
the Mayan calendar, and the ancient Sanskrit scrolls as the most 
accurate representation of our past because they have not been 
changed or altered over the centuries. They say the Bible has been 
tampered with on too many occasions by power and religious groups 
and is no longer accurate. 

All of these great historical documents give us small glimpses into our 
immediate history, but none of them can give us much of a clue about 
any previous civilizations that may have existed here during the past 
millions of years. It is generally considered that our civilization is 
about 6,000 to 8,100 years old, depending on who you talk to. 

The Pleiadians tell us that the Earth is several billion years old and the 
universe is trillions of years old, certainly enough time for many 
civilizations to have come and gone. Of course, you will get many 
disagreements from scientists about how old, big, or long anything is 
because we simply do not have the technology to understand it all. 


Most of history is compiled from old records or some form of scientific 
dating scheme, such as carbon dating. But how could we tell if beings 
from other worlds have ever set foot here and gad an effect on our 
development? Since the Earth has been able to support human life for 
at least a billion years, it's quite possible that there could have been 
many different civilizations that have come and gone. 

If the planet had changed orbit, rolled over on its axis, or met with 
natural disasters of different types, then any traces of these past 
societies may be under the ocean or buried miles under the ground. It 
is interesting that every now and then someone comes up with some 
unexplainable object or event, like a glass bottle buried in a tomb in 
Mexico that should be over 10,000 years old or a mechanical device 
found in the ocean that obviously was made by some form of 
intelligence, but is unrecognizable. How about the report from an 
American university that summarized that the Earth must have been hit 
by a major asteroid or meteorite of some type around 10,000 years ago 
with a force sufficient enough to change the planet's axis, flood all of 
northern Africa, including Egypt, and ruin the atmosphere for years? 
Those were the conclusions of a team of scientists from studies of 
debris found n the floor of the Mediterranean Ocean. 

The Pleiadians are a very old race with information about many 
different civilizations going back 22 million years. Since our forefathers 
were also their forefathers, they have on file every language that has 
been spoken on Earth for thousands of years, as well as information of 
the history of man. Now that the knowledge of the Pleiadians is 
available to us, we can walk through our past and for the first time 
learn the fascinating truth about the development of man on Earth. 

 


22 Million B.C.—Ancient Lyra 

To begin with, in the constellation of Lyra we find the origin of man 
dating back as far as Pleiadian history extends. Here on these ancient 
planets are the ancestors of the oldest known form of human life of 
which they are aware. Twenty-two million years ago ancient Lyran 
travelers first came in to our system and built a colony. Since these 
were among the first attempts at space travel for them, it took a long 
time to reach Earth. When they arrived, they recorded the existence of 
very primitive human beings here. They found that Earth was a planet 
where human life had naturally developed over the course of evolution, 
but it was currently in a very primitive state. The Earth humans were a 
brown-skinned race who barely possessed any powers of reasoning or 
intellect and were of no concern to the celestial visitors. Over the 
course of the next few thousand years many expeditions were made to 
Earth, resulting in a variety of colonies being formed for short periods 
of time. 

The ancient Lyrans were titans, standing 20 to 30 feet tall, from a 
planet much greater in size than ours. They were white-skinned, with 
blond hair, usually had blue eyes, and had a life span of around 2,000 
years. They were a warlike race that had not only developed 
technically, but were quite advanced in the use of spiritual power. They 
moved their warlike forces around the galaxy and used their great 
power to take control of many thousands of lesser-developed races. 
Over the years the Lyran blood line was mixed with other civilizations, 
creating many different colors and races which spread throughout the 
galaxy. 

Just as their race was at its highest peak of advancement, a huge, 
destructive comet that became known as the Destroyer Comet found its way into 


the Lyran family of planets, and two-thirds of their race were killed. 
Along with the destruction, their technology was wiped out, and they 
were unable to continue to exercise control over the great empire they 
had built. The great Lyran Empire had degenerated back to one planet 
with no technology to speak of. They were barely able to survive and 
were faced with the task of rebuilding a civilization which once 
dominated thousands of other worlds. 

After thousands of years, the Lyrans restored their society and again 
became a dominant force in the Galaxy. Pleiadian history documents 
that he Lyrans went through a series of civilizations over a period of 
several millions of years. It was their pattern to rise to power, begin to 
fight among themselves, and then degenerate into a primitive society 
and start all over again. On some occasions their wars were so brutal 
that it took millions of years for them to recover from the primitive 
state left by the destruction. 

 

387,000 B. C—The First Settlement on Earth 

It wasn't until 387,000 B.C. that the Lyrans once again had an effect 
on Earth. Another war had ravaged Lyra, and many of those on the 
losing side had fled for safety. They traveled through the cosmos and 
came to Earth as a place of sanctuary. It was peaceful here; the local 
humans were primitive and offered no resistance to their high 
technology. It was decided they would stay and build a colony. 

Back home in Lyra it was discovered that a large group had fled to 
Earth, and ships were dispatched to come after them. Upon arriving at 
Earth they were disgusted and appalled to find the conditions that 
prevailed here. The local Earth humans were being used as slaves and 


were being mistreated badly. Many were being used in experiments 
where they were being mated with animals, while others were being 
disfigured, raped, or maimed. The colony was an example of the 
darkest side of man. Living in degeneration and filth, it was decided to 
leave the colony on Earth, take away all of their technology, including 
their space ships, and leave the 144,207 Lyran soldiers to their own 
fate on Earth. 

This colony died out after several thousand years, and the spirits of 
the Lyran soldiers that were left behind became part of the spirit world 
of Earth. The 144,207 degenerate Lyran soldiers would now be 
incarnating here along with the original inhabitants. The effect they 
would have on Earth would forever steer it away from a normal 
evolution. 

Lyran history continued to repeat itself for thousands of years until, 
after restoring themselves once again to a high level of technology; 
they built flight machines with beamdrives and once again moved out 
into the cosmos. Their leaders were great scientists with an 
understanding of spiritual power, so once again they began to conquer 
other races. Their leaders soon realized the unlimited powers of the 
spiritual forces and developed them until they became masters of these 
great forces, becoming known as an ISHWISH (IHWH), meaning "god" or 
"king of wisdom." The great power of their spirit allowed them to live for 
thousands of years, and they ruled over countless civilizations. 

The Ishwish leaders ruled with cruel power, and eventually the public 
started a civil uprising. The war lasted for almost four centuries, causing 
the death of more than 60% of the population and nearly destroying the 
three worlds of the Lyra system. It seemed that no one in the Lyra 
systems would escape this slaughter that raged 230,000 years ago. 


 

228,000 B.C. —The Flight from Lyra to the Pleiades 

An Ishwish named Asael could see the end coming and fled from the wars 
with 360,000 people in 183 great spaceships, capable of transporting over 
a thousand passengers each, and 250 small space reconnaissance ships 
that could carry a crew of three. This group of Lyrans wandered through 
space for many years until they came across a star system with 254 still 
young, blue suns. There were already a few colonized planets with 
primitive people living there, but they were no threat to the great Lyran 
technology. They landed and built their new society on three different 
planets around a star they called Taygeta. Life was hard and difficult, and 
it took 300 years or their civilization to grow and adapt to their new 
environment. 

Millions of Lyrans fled the great wars and settled in Orion, Hyades 
and the Pleiades. 

After the new civilization developed, Asael commanded that they start to 
explore and conquer other worlds again, just as they had done in Lyra. 
The powerful beamdrive ships sped out into open space and once main 
established a reign of tyranny over planets of less-developed beings and 
brought them under their control. It was during this time that they came 
into the system known as the Hesperides. A young, underdeveloped form 
of human life was there and was quickly conquered and fell under Asael's 
ruler ship. The Lyrans once again were exercising their power over others 
and beginning to force their rule throughout the galaxy. It seems that the 
forces of greed and power were inbred well into the Lyrans, considering 
that peace seemed to escape them time after time. There had been 
millions of years of bloodshed and wars, and still they had not learned to 


get along peacefully with other races. 

 history1.jpg


The Ancient Lyrians split off to Orion, Hyades, and the Pleiades and started 
new colonies. The planets of the Pleiades soon flourished and spread out to 
Earth, Mars, Hesperides, and Milona. 

 

226,000 B. C.—The Time of Pleja 

Seventy years of conquering had diminished Asael's lust for power, and his 
life of bloodthirsty rule came to an end as the father of the Pleiades passed 
away. Control of the new race of the Pleiades fell to his daughter Pleja, an 
Ishrish, (the female form of an Ishwish) who, like her father, had the blood 
of a warrior. Eager to build their great society even farther, the ordered the 
exploration ships to again seek out new worlds that could fall under her rule. 
As the ships moved out into space once again to explore, they came across 
the trail of the Destroyer Comet which so many years ago had been the 
destructive force that had ended the Lyran Empire. Contained within the tail 
of the great comet, they discovered debris from the planets of ancient Lyra. 
It was decided to follow the comet for awhile and study its path of violence. 


This was the destructive force that had changed the history of Lyra and 
caused death on thousands of worlds, and now it had brought the warriors 
from the Pleiades into a small sun system and the home of a little planet 
called Earth. 

 

225,000 B. C. Earth is Discovered Again 

To their surprise, they discovered a small group of uncivilized people living 
there. Some were brown-skinned and could be traced to the origin of life on 
Earth. Others were of mixed color, but most were white-skinned and had a 
Lyran spirit-form. The Pleiadians had stumbled onto a colony founded by 
their ancient Lyran ancestors who had degenerated into a primitive society. 
Awed by their discovery of human life and common ancestry, it was decided 
to colonize three different planets in the system and continue the family 
chain. News of their discovery was sent back to the home planets and 
apparently sparked an interest in Pleja, for she ordered a great migration to 
be undertaken. Within a very short time thousands of travelers from tie 
Pleiades came and created societies on Earth, Mars, and Milona. Milona was 
a planet which existed beyond the orbit of Mars at that time. 

It was only a few short years before a small war raged on Earth, and many 
of the scientists left to return to the Pleiades, leaving the three planets to 
grow on their own. Pleja was unhappy with this and did not want her new 
colonies to be destroyed, so she dispatched a fleet to stop the war, and 
things calmed down again. 

 

196,000 B.C—War Breaks Out on Earth 

In the home planets the reign of Pleja came to an end, and the people of the 
Pleiades fell into dark times as they ruined their great society in war. The 


three planets of Earth, Mars, and Milona then existed without leadership or 
more than 30,000 years, which was a remarkably long time for Lyrans to 
get along with each other. It seems that some measure of evolution was 
finally happening on Earth. After returning their own civilization to a high 
level of advancement, the scientists of the Pleiades occasionally looked in on 
Earth and watched as technology there had also developed to a high state. 

Unfortunately, the men of Earth started to turn against each other. As the 
wars broke out on Earth, the leaders of the home planets decided once 
again to involve themselves and sent a fleet to put a stop to it. Earth had 
degenerated into such an unruly society that it was decided to evacuate the 
planet and return their people to their home planets. The colonies on the 
planets of Milona and Mars had remained peaceful, they had taken no part in 
the war that raged on Earth, so were left alone by the forces that came from 
the home planets. 

The fighting spirit of Lyra did not lay dormant too long, though, for it only 
took forty years before the people of Milona fell into war and destroyed the 
entire planet in a great explosion. The huge blast pushed Mars out of its 
orbit, causing complete destruction of all life there, and moved the planet 
into a new orbit. All that remains of ancient Milona is the debris of their 
planet, which is now called the asteroid belt. Once again the Lyran fighting 
spirit had caused the destruction of two planets and brought death to 
millions. 

 

116,000 B. C. Earth Is on Its Own 

Over the next 80,000 years many attempts were made at small 
colonization’s, but none lasted. Earth was left alone with no help from 
the home planets, for the Pleiadians had too many problems of their 


own and had no interest in the small colonies that still existed on Earth. 
As time went by, the little blue planet was thought so little of that on 
many occasions; groups of renegades were expelled there. It even 
served as a prison colony for a while. 

Earthman has not developed naturally because of genetic 
engineering by our celestial fathers. 

 

58,000 B.C.—The Great Plan 

Societies had come and gone in the Pleiades, for the old Lyrans could 
never seem to get along for more than 10,000 years without going to 
war. Finally, 60,000 years ago, at a point of high population and 
technology, they decided once again to colonize the Earth. A great 
exodus occurred as hundreds of great spaceships with thousands of 
people came and built up a civilization which would last for 10,000 
years. 

It was a great time for Earth, and the wars in the Pleiades seemed to 
be left behind. Large cities were built that reflected the advanced 
thinking and knowledge of a race with a legacy of millions of years. All 
the continents of Earth were inhabited, and man was living in harmony 
with himself and the planet. It was almost 10,000 years before the 
great society began to quarrel and fight among themselves. This time it 
was the scientists who were the cause of it. They wanted to take 
control and rule through the hand of material technology instead of 
spiritual awareness. The technology was so advanced that weapons had 
been designed that represented a new level of expertise, even for the 
Lyrans. This war was so devastating that it annihilated almost all life 
forms on Earth and erased every trace of their existence. It brought on 


a period when savages roamed the Earth and once again lived in 
primitive villages. The spirits of the original 144,207 Lyrans who came 
to Earth thousands of years before, plus all those who had died since, 
were sleeping on the other side. 

 

48,000 B. C—Pelegon, the First God on Earth 

For several thousand years the Earth was a dormant place of scattered 
tribes; meanwhile, a great war was raging on the three home planets in 
the Pleiades. One of the great Pleiadian leaders of the time, who had 
captured the hearts of many, was a man named Pelegon. He was one 
of the more powerful leaders of his time, earning the title Ishwish 
because of his tremendous understanding of the spiritual laws. He 
could see that the future held great devastation for the people who 
followed him if they stayed the -, so he decided to flee the Pleiades 
and look for a place of safety and refuge-. Upon making his decision to 
leave, he was followed by 70,000 people-, including 200 scientists, 
and fled the wars which were bringing death to so many. It was known 
to Pelegon that Earth could support life similar to the home planets 
and was largely uninhabited at the time. Fleeing the tyranny and death 
that always seemed to follow the Lyran family, he led his people on a 
quiet and peaceful Earth to start a new life. 

As the Earth grew under the leadership of Pelegon's 200 appointed sub 
leaders, the worst war of all time was still raging on the home worlds. 
But under Pelegon's leadership and the guidance of his lieutenants, 
they populated the many continents of Earth and created a society of 
love and spiritual growth. Life was flourishing and peaceful as Pelegon 
was good to his people. He taught them the ways of spirit and how life 


should be lived by observing the Laws of Creation. This was a society 
built on spiritual knowledge instead of material greed and power, and 
it was working. 

The true natives of Earth, the brown-skinned race, were in awe of the 
great power of the Ishwish, Pelegon. They were very underdeveloped 
in comparison to the settlers from the stars, but lived in harmony and 
peace with them, and Pelegon treated them with respect and love. A 
master of the knowledge of material life through the development of 
spirit, Pelegon's seemingly magical abilities caused many stories among 
the Earthlings, which told of his abilities to rule over life and death. One 
story was passed on that he was once seen floating in air, held up by 
the power of his mind; and by casting a look at a small tree, he 
caused it to grow. Because of the great power over life and death the 
Earth people believed he possessed, they called him "God," generating 
the idea that "God" was a man who held power over life and death. It 
was Pelegon who became the first god image on Earth, thus starting 
the concept that we were created in his image. 

Finally, in the Pleiades the spiritual leaders were able to overtake the 
scientists, and peace reigned at last. The people learned to trust in the 
truths of Creation and the knowledge and wisdom of the spiritual laws. 
This is a normal process in the development of most races, for in the 
beginning stages of development man lives entirely by material sense 
and thinking. And then as he evolves through numerous lifetimes, he 
slowly learns that he is more than just a physical being and begins to 
solve the problems of life with more spiritual solutions. At a certain 
point in the development of a race, enough people advance spiritually, 
and the old material ways of force and power give way to the more 
spiritual ways of love and light. With this kind of shift in 


consciousness, societies experience monumental change. This change 
came to the Pleiadians, and over the next 8,000 years they developed 
themselves to a very high spiritual level, and they were at last able to 
leave behind the long legacy of war and bloodshed of their Lyran past. 
They still live by those peaceful standards today. 

Nothing was known on Earth of the peace in the Pleiades. Pelegon as 
still ruler and for the first time in 300,000 years, Earth was living 
peacefully and happy. The force of his spirit allowed him to live for 
4,000 years, during which time he guided the planet to a degree of 
spiritual development that surpassed anything known in Lyran history. 
His vision of life helped this great civilization last for almost 10,000 
years before a new Ishwish by the name of Jesas came into power. 

Jesas lacked the morals and knowledge of Pelegon and began to rule 
through power and control over others. He had only ruled for twenty 
years before the people would no longer stand for their world being 
ruined; they rose up against him, causing war to break out again. After 
living for thousands of years in peace caused by the love of the great 
Pelegon, the people wanted no part in a world of war. So, by the 
hundreds of thousands they fled to a nearby star system known as Beta 
Centauri, leaving behind a war that brought total destruction to Earth. 

 

31,000 RC—Atlantis and Mu 

There are few myths or fables that capture the imagination of man 
more than the story of ancient Atlantis. If it really existed, what 
happened to it, and why is there no trace of its existence? Stories have 
been passed down for centuries about the huge island continent that 
existed between what today is called Africa and South America, a place 


where our forefathers lived in a society even more advanced than ours 
and traveled the stars. As an example of how Pleiadian technology can 
change fable to fact, here is the true story of Atlantis and our 
connection to it. 

After the great exodus to the planets in the Beta Centauri area and the 
destruction of life on Earth, there was a span of 7,000 years when 
travelers avoided coming here. The only life to be found was a few 
scattered tribes of brown-skinned humans who lived in primitive huts. 
They were the original Earth inhabitants, who were still very 
underdeveloped, and were of no interest to the star travelers. Gone 
was the technology of the great society of Pelegon that had raised the 
consciousness of man to new heights. The Earth had fallen into a time 
of darkness and despair. 

Light years away lived the descendants of those who had fled the Earth 
thousands of years ago. Here in the Barnard Star System, a society of 
human life flourished and lived peacefully. After all, they were the sons 
and daughters of the great Pelegon, who had taught them how to live 
in peace and harmony with Creation. This rich heritage provided them 
with a spiritual advancement that left behind the cries of war and the 
struggle for power, and created a world of peace and spiritual growth. 

Among the leaders was a kind and generous Ishwish named Atlant. He 
was a tall, blond-haired, broad-shouldered man of obvious Lyran 
decent. His bright blue eyes and pale white skin painted a picture not 
unlike his Lyran ancestors of millions of years ago. He was very 
popular, and although life there was peaceful and happy, he longed to 
lead his followers to a now world where they could start a life full of 
adventure and growth. There were many who decided to follow Atlant, 
and plans were made to migrate to Earth, a small planet their 


ancestors had lived on that was hospitable to human life. Here they 
could create a whole new world. 

At first only a few came and found the Earth to be rough and 
untamed. After piloting their great ships over most of the Earth's 
surface, they decided to build their first city on a large continent 
located just above the line of the equator, which had a warm climate 
good for living. Having lived peacefully for thousands of years, their 
technology had developed to a very high state, so it was only a very 
short time before the beautiful architecture of the star travelers began 
to fill the horizon. As the city grew and word reached back to the 
home planets of the success of their new home, thousands more left 
the Barnard System and came to Earth. Within only a few short years 
the great society, named after its leader Atlant, had populated a large 
area of the planet. 

There are seven basic colors of humanity in the universe: White, 
brown, red, yellow, blue, green, and black. Six are represented 
on Earth. 

Based on our current calendar, the beginnings of Atlantis would be 
around 31,000 B.C. Some history of this event still rests with the 
American Indians and some other races, which have for years passed 
down the story of the great Atlantis. The people of Atlantis were kind 
and generous and lived peacefully with the inhabitants of Earth. 
Although the Earthlings were far less developed, they were accepted 
into their cities and found jobs and encouragement, for no hate or 
prejudice existed in the minds of these spiritually developed travelers 
from the stars. 

Atlant had a wife named Karyatide, who was also ambitious and well 


thought of as a leader. She helped spread the civilization to new parts 
of the planet, founding cities around an area that today we call the 
Mediterranean. 

These smaller satellite cities were called Little Atlantis and lived under 
the same peaceful rule as the large cities. 

Karyatide had a father named Muras. He was a powerful leader from 
the Lyran chain of families. After the successful beginnings of Atlantis, 
he came to Earth with thousands of his followers and built a city on 
the opposite side of the planet called Mu. Named after its founder, Mu 
grew to be a gigantic city; it slowly spread out and founded other 
parts of the planet. After many years the many cities that fell under 
the rule of Muras became known as the kingdom of Lemuria. 

Mu was situated in the area we now call the Gobi desert, which is an 
area between China and Russia. As the great society of Mu advanced, 
they built two underground cities called Agharta Alpha and Agharta 
Beta, located directly below Mu. The cities were connected together by 
underground tube systems which ran for hundreds of miles, carrying 
the citizens of Mu from one town to another. Eventually, even more 
underground tube systems were built and connected many areas of 
Earth. Although most of these underground tunnels have been 
destroyed over the years, some of them still exist today. 

Thousands of years of peaceful living on Earth produced the largest 
population ever to live here. Almost the entire planet was populated 
with cities on every continent that boasted a high quality of living and 
technology. Earth became known as a peaceful and tranquil place to 
live, attracting travelers from many different parts of the galaxy. 
Pleiadian history is not completely accurate here, but it is believed 


that as many as eight more races from different worlds came to Earth 
during this time and blended in with the great societies of Atlantis and 
Mu. 

From the star called Sirius came a race of black humans who were 
very highly developed. They were not of the Lyran chain, but boasted 
a high spiritual level; they found it easy to live in peace with the 
artistic and creative people of Atlantis. Other humans came from the 
stars of Orion, Vega, and Hyades, who were also descendants of the 
ancient Lyrans. It was also during this time that a race arrived and 
started a new colony on Earth whose origins are still not known. They 
were an older race than the Lyrans and kept to themselves and were 
very peaceful. These were the colonies that founded the Asian 
communities on Earth, a different family of origin, but now part of the 
ever-changing mixture of the new Earthman. The Earth was becoming 
a melting pot of races and colors who lived together in peace and love. 

 

16,000 B. C.—Exiled to Beta Centauri 

For 15,000 years the Earth lived in peace, the longest time for any 
civilization to ever make it here. It was a time of spiritual growth and 
development for all who shared the Earth. But as things would go, 
trouble started when a group of young scientists, bent on controlling 
others, tries to cause problems. Hungry for power, the peace of Earth 
was threatened for the first time in thousands of years. Fortunately, the 
people recognized the potential trouble and drove the scientists off of 
the planet. They fled into space towards a star called Beta Centauri, the 
closest sun system to Earth, located just 4.3 light years away. Here 
they found human life on a planet and lived in exile. 


For two thousand years these same exiled scientists and their followers 
schemed for revenge, while they built up great power and increased 
their life span. Because of their hatred for the rulers of Earth, they 
plotted to return and seek revenge and eventually attacked Earth. They 
were led by the Ishwish, Arus, who intended to destroy Atlantis and Mu. 
Robbing, murdering, but only able to take over small regions of land, 
they settled in the northern area called Hyperborea, which is today 
known as Florida. The Earth had not suffered through its axis shift yet, 
so Hyperborea was still north of the equator. 

 

13,000 B. C. Adam and Eve 

The second in power to Arus was a mighty scientist named Semjasa. He 
and the other followers were under strict orders not to have sex or 
social interaction of any kind with the original Earth inhabitants, who 
were very underdeveloped and even genetically impaired from 
experiments performed on them by the Lyrans years ago. Keeping to 
himself, Semjasa defied the orders and worked in secret, performing 
his genetic mixtures with animals and the sub developed Earth humans. 
He created many different forms of creatures and humans as he 
searched for a way to improve on man. In one experiment he mated an 
Earth female, called an Eva, with the higher evolved and older Lyran 
genetics, and created a more intelligent Earthman whom he called an 
Adam. In the Lyran language Adam simply meant Earth human: it was 
not his name. The Adam, by the way, was blond, blue-eyed, and stood 
about 16 feet tall. 

The experiment worked so well that Semjasa tried it again and created 
another Adam, a female. Both of his Adams were great advancements 


in the human form and were more like the Lyrans than the Earth 
humans. As their intelligence and evolution had been greatly improved, 
he decided to keep them alive for study and kept their existence secret 
for many years. When they reached maturity, he mated the two Adams 
together. This was the beginning of the legend of Adam and Eve. 

The two Adams had a child called Seth, who became the first-born son 
of the new human race on Earth. It had been 22 million years since the Lyrans 
had first used the Earth humans to create all manner of ape like 
creatures, ruining the natural evolution of the Earth human, and now 
Semjasa had created the beginning of the wise and intelligent human 
race It was his hope that he had been able to set things right and 
repair some of the damage caused by his ancestors so many years ago. 
Even though the natural evolution of Earth had been altered so many 
times, he had succeeded in giving Earthman a new chance to survive 
and grow. This was the birth of our current civilization as we know it. 

Some of the apes were created out of experiments mating man 
together with monkeys, and are not natural forms in creation. 

 

Arus and his band of terrorists continually started small wars around 
the planet, but these little skirmishes hardly had any impact on the 
great society of Atlantis and were not much of a bother for hundreds of 
years. Eventually Arus died, and his son Arus II continued to attack 
remote areas, taking control of what are now India, Pakistan, and 
Persia. They came in contact with the Sumerians, a peace-loving people 
who fled to the north for safety because they wanted nothing to do with 
the army created by Arus II. The Sumerians were tall, dark, and the 
descendants of the Syrians who first settled on Earth at the same time 


that Atlant started Atlantis. The Sumerians moved into the mountains 
and became an influence on the people living in India, Pakistan, and 
Iraq. The region they lived in was called Sumer and was a part of what 
is called ancient Mesopotamia. Later their ancestors would found cities 
known as Ur, Uruk, Kish, and Lagash, which have all become major 
archeological sites in southern Iraq. The great knowledge of the 
Sumerians was handed down through the centuries and is preserves in 
pictographic and cuneiform writings that are still being examined today. 
The Sumerians are, for the most part, responsible for preserving the 
knowledge of life that was known during the time of Atlantis. 

India was then called Arya, and after a few centuries split from Arus II 
and made alliances with the great cities of Mu and Agharta. These small 
wars, which had no effect on the great power of Atlantis, lasted another 
fifteen hundred years. Arus II grew old and was dying, but he 
succeeded in infiltrating his leaders into Atlantis and Mu, causing 
enough dissension to begin the talk of war. 

 

9498 B.C.—The End of Atlantis and Mu 

The cries of war caused panic, and by the thousands the people too 
took to their Beamships and fled to the Pleiades for safety. The war 
instruments of Atlantis and Mu were of very large size and power. The 
army of Atlantis contained 4.83 million fighters in large ships, plus 
123,000 small, individual Beamships and 16,431 remote ships 
equipped with the most sophisticated heat-dissolving beams. They 
also had 24,230 medium-class ships which were armed with terrifying 
weapons. But even with all this power, Mu was superior in technology 
and boasted weapons of greater force. 


The scientists of Mu, knowing of the coming events, ordered a fleet 
out into space to search for a large asteroid in the debris of the 
destroyed planet of Milona. Finding it, they attached a powerful drive 
system to it so that it could be hurled at Earth as a weapon of 
destruction. As the attack of Atlantis started, the leaders of Mu ordered 
the giant asteroid to be launched, but it was too late to save Mu. The 
Atlantean fleet dissolved the city of Mu almost instantly. All traces of 
Mu were melted away, which is evident by the smooth, flat ground in 
the Gobi desert where it once stood. The underground cities of 
Agharta were damaged and thousands were killed, but many survived 
the great holocaust. 

Rapidly, the giant asteroid was steered toward Earth, with the 
dedicated pilots attached to it. Propelled by the great technology of 
the scientists of Mu, the huge asteroid of death was racing at 
incredible speeds toward Earth when some of leaders and scientists of 
Atlantis detected the oncoming asteroid. They knew there was no way 
to stop it, so they fled into space, leaving the millions of inhabitants of 
Atlantis to die. 

The asteroid hit the atmosphere and burst like a supernova, 
generating heat of over 34,000 degrees. The asteroid exploded less 
than 110 miles up, and in a thousand small pieces hit the Earth like a 
shotgun blast. The continent of Atlantis melted beneath the heat of the 
blast within seconds, and the floor of the Atlantic Ocean was broken, 
causing volcanoes to erupt and bringing the sea to a boil. Water from 
the ocean hurled upward to height of twenty miles, causing a tidal 
wave over a mile high to rush over the landmass of Atlantis. It 
continued on across the area we call the Mediterranean and flooded 
Northern Africa and the land of Egypt. By our current calendar it was 


exactly the year 9498 B.C., on June 6th, when the great civilization of 
Atlantis sank beneath the Ocean. 

The planet Earth rolled over on its axis, causing the seas to flow over 
the land, and volcanoes filled the air with smoke and fire. As the planet 
changed its axis and came to a rest in a slightly different orbit, the 
geography of Earth was forever changed. If you can picture the Earth 
as it is now, envision rolling the planet over until the state of Florida is 
where Greenland is now. That was the position Earth was in before the 
Great War. 

Florida used to be called Hyperborea and was the home of Arus and 
his warriors. The survivors of Hyperborea moved underground after the great 
holocaust and now live under Mt. Shasta in California. The great 
continent of Atlantis, which was originally north of the equator, slid 
under water and is now resting in the area of the Atlantic Ocean. 
From what I can ascertain from reading the Contact Notes, if you drew 
a line from Puerto Rico over to Northern Africa, you would be 
outlining the northern border of where Atlantis was. This huge land 
mass formerly connected the continents of Africa and South America, 
but now is barely a memory. Remains of Atlantis can be found on the 
ocean floor off the west coast of the Bahamas in a small group of 
islands called the Biminis. Here on the floor of the sea, 
oceanographers have discovered the remains of what appears to be 
an ancient city and have uncovered roads, walls, and other 
monuments which may tell the story of the last days of Atlantis. Also 
south of Puerto Rico, deep down under the water, you can find the 
tops of pyramids built by the Atlantean that still rise up through the 
ocean floor. This is all we have found so far to remind us of the 
greatest society that ever existed on Earth. 


 

9448 B. C.—Jehovan Controls the Earth 

Soon after the war of revenge by Arus II, he was murdered by his 
third-born son, Jehovan, who seized power over the Aryans and the 
other two remaining nations of life on Earth. The tremendous 
destruction caused by the asteroid hitting the Earth had left the 
atmosphere unbreathable on most parts of the planet, driving the 
survivors underground. It was fifty years before the air began to 
clear up and small tribes of people began to once again be seen on 
Earth. There were three basic groups of people left after the 
destruction: 

First Nation The descendants of the Armus people who lived in the 
area known as Armenia since 33,000 years ago; they were 
immigrants from the Pleiades system. 

Second Nation The scattered tribes of Persia, India, and Pakistan, 
who were known as the Aryans at that time. 

Third Nation A world-wide spread of Gypsies called Hebrews, which 
in the ancient language of the Pleiades Was Hehrons. 

An Ishwish named Jehovan governed the three tribes until 7,000 years 
ago when he was murdered by his only son Jehav, who, like his father, 
called himself the creator of man. During this time, a group of 160,000 
Great Aryans deserted the rule of Jehav and wandered through the 
lands to the east, moving into the area between the Caspian Sea in 
northern Iran and Arahat Mountain in Turkey. This area was full of the 
descendants of the Sumerians, who led the local people with great 
discipline because of their highly developed knowledge of spiritual 
powers. The Aryans attacked and pressed the people into bondage and 


created a new state. Deprived of all technology, the Aryans soon began 
to mingle with the natives, and all previous talents and knowledge 
soon disappeared and were forgotten forever. 

It was only 1320 B.C. when Jehav was murdered by his first son, 
Arussem, who had two sons named Salam and Ptaah; they were more 
peaceful in nature and stood up against Arussem, driving him and his 
followers out of power. Arussem did not have the power to fight back, 
for his followers were few and his technology was no match for the 
great armies commanded by his sons, so he secretly returned and hid 
in an underground city below the Gizeh Pyramid in Egypt. He made 
plans to take over the world by controlling the thoughts of world 
leaders and filling their minds with lies, deceit, and delusion. 
Meanwhile, Ptaah and Salam governed together and created peace 
until Ptaah was stricken by a disease and died in his 93rd year. This 
left Salam to rule until he became old and weak, turning the rule over 
to his son Plejos in 40 B.C. 

Plejos was a peaceful ruler and had aligned himself with the High 
Council of the Pleiadian System. Arrusem, meanwhile, had been 
governing his band of evil followers, called the Bafath, and hiding in 
Egypt since 1010 B.C. He was taken over by a ruthless leader named 
Henn, whom the Hebrons called Jehova. He was known as "the Cruel 
One" to his followers. 

In 80 B.C. Henn was overthrown by a new leader named Kamagol I. 
He and his followers had to hide from the power of Plejos, and were 
forced to continue living below ground under the Great Pyramid in Egypt; 
their technology was failing and their life spans dwindling. His son, 
Kamagol II, was even more ruthless than he was; and as soon as he was 
old enough, he challenged his father for power. After seizing control, he 


put his father in a deep, dark dungeon and left him there for years until he 
died. He was one of the last long-living leaders and would die in 1975, 
leaving 2,100 of his evil followers behind. By this time the Bafath, deprived 
of most of their technology, were controlling the minds of 723 Earth people 
through telepathic means, and these 723 represented their last hope for 
controlling Earth. 

 

10 A.D.—The Pleiadians Leave the Earth 

Two thousand years ago, Plejos, the last Pleiadian System leader on Earth, 
was informed of the peace agreement between the Pleiades System and 
the High Council of Andromeda. A new era of spiritual growth and peace 
had come to the Pleiades, causing Plejos and his followers to want to 
return to their home system. It was decided to leave someone behind who 
could carry on the teachings of the Creational knowledge taught by the 
Pleiadians. They would need an Earthman who was a leader among men 
and who could carry on the teachings of higher consciousness. 

This human was called Jmmanuel. He was not born of Lyran descent, but 
as a very evolved spirit-form capable of the highest order of spiritual 
understanding. It was arranged for Jmmanuel to be procreated from a 
father of high evolution from the Pleiades, named Gabriel, and an Earth 
woman of Lyran descent, named Mary. As the Pleiadians had hoped, 
Jmmanuel easily grasped the teachings of spirit and provided the 
foundation for what is today called Christianity. He lived for 115 years and 
brought the truth to all he could through his teachings. Seventy-four years 
after his death in the ear 189 A.D., his name was changed to Jesus Christ, 
and his teachings were written down to form the religious teachings that 
prevail today. 


The Pleiadians draw our attention to the fact that we have spent 
more energy killing each other over Jesus than we have spent 
learning from his teachings. 

Plejos and his followers had returned to the Pleiades and ended thousands 
of years of Pleiadian and Lyran influence. They would not return until 1685 
A.D. It had taken thousands of years of bloodshed before spiritual 
understanding had overtaken the material warriors and brought peace to 
the troubled Lyran spirit-forms in the Pleiades. 

 

The Codex 

Here on Earth still live the spirits of the first travelers to Earth, the 
144,207 Lyrans who came here to escape the wars on their home 
planets. Two thousand of these old Lyrans were the leaders that were 
responsible for the abuse and experimentation of the original Earthmen. 
It was their conduct that set the pattern and leadership for the most 
decadent and immoral society yet to live on Earth. As their spirits 
passed away to the other side, they took with them a karmic, or 
spiritual, debt from the material life. Imbedded deep within their 
spiritual consciousness and their akashic records are the memories of 
their many violations of the Laws of Creation. Each time they have 
returned to material life, they live under what is called the Codex, a 
karmic debt that must be repaid. 

We are more than just material bodies with a consciousness. We are 
spiritual beings who go through a series of material lives in order to 
evolve through experiences learned during the material life. All spiritual 
beings are consciously connected to the Creational Energy, which is the 
true eternity of all things. Our spirits would not be able to have 


consciousness without the life force energy it receives from the 
Creation or God Force as some call it. It is this life force energy, a kind 
of cosmic electrical force, which empowers the spirit so it can exist. It 
is this common connection to the Creation that binds us all together 
spiritually. 

As each person thinks each thought, it carries like a ripple through 
Creation and has some effect on all things. The Creation itself is the 
spiritual energy of the universe; each of us is a spirit-form from that 
energy. Our connection is through a spiritual consciousness that can 
be sensed through meditation. All of our actions and thoughts then 
pass through our consciousness and go out into the universe through 
this spiritual consciousness. This is how we all contribute to the whole 
of the evolution of the Creation. 

If our actions are of a violent nature, such as in murder, these actions 
affect the balance of the consciousness of Creation. Our actions and 
thoughts do not simply dissipate or disappear, but are recorded in the 
ethers of the universe in what are called akashic, or etheric, records 
and are a part of the spiritual being of Creation. 

The actions and murderous deeds of the 2,000 leaders of the ancient 
Lyrans had an effect on Creation and are recorded in the akashic 
records of Earth. If you take the life of another through murder, then 
Creation records this within the spiritual consciousness of the spirit-
form and keeps track of it as a debt owed. 

Let's say you murder someone through a violent act. Their spirit-form then 
passes on to the other side while you live out your material life for another 
ten years, and then your spirit-form passes over to the other side as well. 
This action is recorded within your own akashic record and the record of the 


one you killed. It has become part of the events of Creation and cannot be 
undone. But since we are beings of energy, the debt can be repaid through 
the Laws of Energy which are ruled by Creation. Here is how it works. 

Once you have murdered someone and you both have died, both of your 
spirits are on the other side and no longer in material form. The debt you 
owe can only be repaid in the material, so nothing will happen as a 
consequence of this action on the other side. However, once your spirit-form 
and the spirit-form of the one you murdered are both back in the material, 
the debt can be settled. It is not necessary that you know each other. It is 
only required that you both be in the material world at the same time. If the 
person who was murdered becomes ill or is suffering spiritually somehow 
and is in need of strength, he can take from the life force energy of the 
murderer to help himself. This is not a conscious act, for neither know each 
other or have any memory of the previous murder. They do not even have 
to be in the same area of the planet or in close proximity to one another. It 
is a natural function of energy in Creation that moves life force energy from 
the murderer to the injured party. The victim will receive a flow of energy, 
which is taken from the life force of the murderer, and will start to feel 
better. The murderer, without knowing why, will suddenly lose some of his 
life force and perhaps become ill in some form. Since the debt is a spiritual 
one, it is not necessary that the material consciousness of either party have 
any idea of what is going on. 

The 2,000 Lyran leaders, who murdered and committed violent crimes of 
genetic engineering against their fellow man, have many spiritual debts to 
pay. Living a material life with a spiritual debt to pay is called living under 
the Codex. It may be discovered by an individual through meditation, for the 
recordings of his thoughts are available in his akashic record, a band of 
energy around the Earth where all thoughts exist. 


As we are moving into the New Age and the vibration level of the Creational 
energies are increasing, most of the old Lyran spirits are coming back into 
material life. For some, there are many debts to pay. It is this Codex which 
will silently move them to be the light workers of our new world, for they are 
driven to help out their fellow man and make a difference. Most will never 
know why they are driven or that they live under a Codex. But by virtue of 
their older and more experienced spiritual selves, most will find themselves 
playing a part in the development of the new world. 

The Pleiadians are well aware of these old spirits and know that the can be 
awakened and can help to be a force for good in our society. They have 
allowed pictures of their Beamships to be taken, which will stir feelings 
in some; others will be slowly awakened by the teachings of Creation 
and the understanding of spirit. The Pleadians believe that if they 
provide the right teachings, the right words and ideas, the spiritual 
consciousness of thousands of old warriors can be slowly awakened. 
And if fed the knowledge of love and light, these beings can be brought 
to the front lines again to fight for world that is sadly lacking in human 
understanding and spiritual knowledge. 

Having lived previous lives on worlds more advanced than ours, their 
accumulated spiritual wisdom will keep them from being easy prey to 
the illogical thinking which holds most Earthmen in spiritual stagnation. 
Theirs is the ability to rise above the common man and be the leaders 
of a new era. They are the visionaries, the creative thinkers, the 
scientists, the writers, and leaders who can envision a world greater 
than our own. Most of these old Lyrans have been prominent in history 
each time they have come into a material life. Since they have many 
more lifetimes and have accumulated much wisdom and experience, 
they will usually feel uncomfortable on Earth and try to change it. A 


sense of being out of place or in the wrong time is not unusual. Many 
may have visions of other worlds far more advanced than ours and long 
to leave here. 

During my visit to Switzerland, there was an occasion when I was 
visiting with one of the F.I.G.U. members about the Codex, and I was 
shown a book which recorded the lives of many of the old Lyran spirits. 
Each page provided the names and accomplishments of many different 
spiritual being. As I looked through this book, I was surprised to see so 
many historic names. Truly, the old Lyrans have been working under 
the Codex for thousands of years. For better or worse, they always 
seem to make their mark in society in some way. 

The book went on to say that there were five different colonization’s of 
Lyrans on Earth, some more violent than others. They had been the 
white seed that had forever changed the evolution of man on Earth. 
Currently, two-thirds of the white race on Earth is of the Lyran genetic 
as a result of these five colonization’s. 

As I flipped through the pages of the book, most of the names were 
unfamiliar to me, but on one page there were the names of 12 different 
spirits listed. I didn't recognize any of the names. The page looked 
different from the others, so I had to ask about it. The names were of a 
special group of Lyrans who were now all in material life on Earth. The 
Pleiadians had given the names to Billy, and he was to watch out for 
these 12, for they would be drawn to him for reasons which were not 
explained to me. 

I was told that they believed that I was one of the 12, possibly number 
4, based on the information I had given them about my dreams and my 
family background. Other considerations as to why they thought I was 


one of them were not explained to me. I inquired as to whether or not 
any of the other names had shown up, but was told they had not. As of 
1987, so far I was the only one. 

 

The Future of Earth 

Through the awareness of how our current civilization came about, we 
can begin to see ourselves in a new light. The white race on Earth is 
not superior to other races, only older than most. If two-thirds of the 
white race is of the Lyran descent, then they have lived more material 
lifetimes than other races and have more of an obligation to be 
teachers and role models to those who are younger. As we learn more 
about our origins and our history, perhaps we can start to come 
together as one people—the people of Earth. 

It is easy to see, by the history of the Lyrans, that man has chosen the 
path of power and greed to guide his destiny, instead of the more 
spiritual path of love and understanding. Here on Earth are the spirits 
of these old Lyran warriors who are still playing a part in our 
development as a civilization. We can learn a great lesson from this 
legacy of history. Here we are again, a planet of diverse people whose 
leaders refuse to get along, but instead play a dangerous game of "King 
on the Mountain." Just as in the Lyran past, we are in a dangerous 
position where we have the technology to destroy our civilization, and it 
is in the hands of power-crazy men who are obsessed with the lust for 
control over others. The sickness of prejudice rules their thinking as 
they finance wars so that men can kill one another. 

If we are to have peace on Earth, we must rise up against the negative 
thinking that controls Earth. We must use the power of love and light to 


diffuse the anger and hostility that causes us to fight. I have always 
liked the expression, "Suppose they gave a war, and nobody showed 
up." If the teachers of the New Age can use the power of their light to 
show others how to live with unconditional love and balance in their 
lives, we can convince a lot of people to "not show up." The answer lies 
in the knowledge that we are spiritual beings and are all connected 
together in Creation. If we can see each other as spirits and not 
material beings of color and race, we can discover the spiritual bonding 
that will lead us to peace instead of war. 

Earth is moving into a time of spiritual awareness. As the high energy 
of the New Age takes its effect, more and more Earth people will begin 
to discover their spiritual selves and develop the powers of higher 
consciousness. As this event naturally happens, these spiritually aware 
people will provide the evidence that we are more than just material 
beings. Others will see that there is more to life than just the material 
existence, and a consciousness will develop to oppose the cries of war 
and hatred. For the first time in the development of our current 
civilization, there will be a more spiritual and peaceful solution to our 
problems than war. Earth will start to learn that we can all live together 
in peace if we shed the need for material power and greed. Real 
happiness in life does not come from the attainment of material 
possessions, but from the inner peace and love that is found on the 
spiritual path. 

At first these spiritual arguments against war will be laughed at and 
disregarded by the powers that rule. Spiritual people will be regarded as 
unrealistic and crazy. But very quickly, within a few short years, we will 
see the tide shift as the people of Earth are drawn more to the spiritual 
way, which provides a way to live in peace and harmony. Eventually, 


over the next hundred years, the acceleration of higher energy will so 
dramatically change the consciousness of Earth that a whole new society 
will emerge that will forever change the way we live together. 

If, however, we do not learn from the history lesson given to us by the 
Pleiadians, we may become just one more chapter in the ongoing list of 
past civilizations that have destroyed themselves. 

 

The Chronology of Earth History 

This chart shows important moments in Earth history based on 
information from the Pleiadians. Dates are only estimates to show the 
chronology of events. 

22 Million B.C. The first Lyrans come to Earth and colonize.

Life in the Pleiades 

Billy likes to talk about what he has learned from the Pleiadians. His 
contacts were mostly all with Semjase, the Pleiadian woman of whom 
he obviously has fond memories. I could even feel a little sadness in 
him when he spoke about her. It was obvious that he greatly missed 
her. I remember one night in particular we were standing outside under 
the clear, beautiful Swiss sky, and he was pointing out into the stars to 
show me where the Pleiades were. I was asking him about the planet 
Erra, where the Pleiadians had come from, and if he ever had the 
chance to go there. According to the information I had learned so far, 
he had not visited the Pleiades or seen their civilization. But I was 
wrong. He had traveled there in 1984 with Quetzal, the Pleiadian base 
commander on Earth, and spent three days learning about this 
advanced culture. 


Quetzal had frequently come by to see Billy after his normal contacts 
had stopped with Semjase. They had become good friends, and Quetzal 
ad invited Billy to return to the home planet of Erra with him. Quetzal 
needed to return there for some reason, and Billy was welcome to go 
with him. 

 

Visiting the Pleiades 

Even though Quetzal had been stationed on Earth for many years, his 
home was still in the Pleiades. Whenever he had the chance, he would 
return for a few days to once again be among the level of 
consciousness that as more comfortable for him. Here he could relax 
and let the concerns of his command vanish for a while and enjoy the 
serenity of his home world. 

As he and Billy approached Erra, Quetzal explained how their society 
had developed into a peaceful world of unity and harmony. Billy was 
well aware that the Pleiadians had not always lived like this, but had 
won their peace through thousands of years of war and struggle, a 
lesson that he hoped would be understood on Earth. 

As the speeding Beamship broke into the Pleiadian atmosphere, Billy 
was surprised to see that the terrain looked so much like Earth. Not 
only as Erra mostly water, but the mountains and forest reminded him 
of his own home in Switzerland. There were no large cities with 
towering buildings as on Earth, but instead the small population of 
Erra was spread out into smaller communities that spanned the planet. 
Even within these local communities, people lived in more rural 
settings and kept a distance from each other. It was like they were 
living with nature, tucked away in little settlements that were almost 


undetectable from the ground. 

As they flew over several small populated areas that looked like cities, 
Quetzal explained that almost all of the manufacturing and production 
of products for living was done on other planets in their solar system 
so as to not upset the ecology on Erra. They had long since developed 
a balance with nature that was well protected. Nowhere on Erra was 
there a smoke stack or pollution of any kind. The atmosphere was 
perfectly clean and healthy; this helped contribute to their good health 
and to their long life span of over 700 years. 

The Beamship touched down on a landing area at Quetzal's home. The 
ship's drive systems were shut down, and Billy and Quetzal stepped 
out into a beautiful, clear, and sunny day. One deep breath of the high 
oxygen content was all Billy needed to be reminded of how poor the 
air on Earth had become. Quetzal had informed him that on Earth the 
oxygen content was dropping to very dangerous proportions, which 
would lead to disease and the damage of nature. Here on Erra, Billy's 
lungs gasped as he felt the surge of pleasure from the clean air. Just 
the idea that the Pleiadians were being so careful with their world was 
very encouraging. 

The main house was white in color and resembled a dome structure lot 
unlike some future-looking homes on Earth. Quetzal showed Billy 
around and explained some of the technology that was built into the 
home that monitored the air, communications, food supply, sleep, 
health, and many other aspects of living. Organic intelligence, much 
like that of the Beamships, was also present here and was built into 
the house, helping to create a high standard of living. 

Located just a few hundred yards from the main house was another 


similar-looking home that housed another of Quetzal's families. He had 
two marriages and two families of children. Here on Erra this was very 
common as you can certainly love more than one person, and in a 
society that has all but eliminated emotional problems such as 
jealousy, most Pleiadians entered into more than one marriage. In 
Quetzal's case, his marriages were quite successful and were providing 
him with many hours of pleasure with his wives and children. 

Many Pleiadians have gardens, but don't actually work in them. The 
task of maintaining the gardens and food supply was normally carried 
out by machines. Quetzal was proud to show Billy that he was working 
his own garden with a set of hand tools that Billy had provided him 
with from Earth. 

 

It was quite an odd thing for Quetzal to be out working in his own 
garden without machines. He even had garden gloves, seeds, and 
shovels from Earth, which had attracted quite a bit of attention from 
his neighbors, for they had never seen this before. The idea of working 
with the soil and getting your hands all dirty was quite a novelty and 
was catching on with Quetzal's friends. 

Beyond the garden was another interesting-looking building that had 
special interest to Quetzal. He had taken advantage of his travels to 
many worlds and started a collection of different kinds of vehicles. 
There were many cars, bikes, and trucks from Earth, as well as many 
other travel vehicles that were very unusual and strange to Billy. 
Quetzal had over a hundred strange contraptions in his little museum 
and took great pride in understanding all of them. He often worked on 
them and kept them all in good running condition. 


The Pleiadians have long understood the power of thought and the 
spiritual bonding that connects all living beings together through 
Creation. Because of this, they are very protective of the 
consciousness of thought that is created by all who live there. Over 
thousands of years of development, their thought processes are tuned 
into one another at very high levels. If visitors to Erra project negative 
thoughts, they will be asked to leave the planet so as to not disturb 
the wonderful balance of thought energy that everyone enjoys. 

The ability to project thoughts to another place on the planet is very 
common and is the socially accepted method of visiting. Telepathy, the 
ability to communicate by thought, is practiced by most of the 
population. Devices such as phones are nonexistent. Try for a moment 
to envision what life would be like if everyone on the planet were 
contributing part of their thought energy to a common pool that was 
used to protect the health and well-being of the planet, the animal 
kingdom, the food, and the health of all inhabitants. There would be 
no greed, hate, anger, or negative thinking, but only true 
understanding and love among everyone. 

Even though most communication is mental, there is still a tube type 
of system to travel around the planet. You can travel to almost 
anywhere on the planet in a very short time. This tube system is 
mostly above ground and available to everyone. When you are riding 
on the tube, there is no sensation of movement because the problems 
of gravity and energy have long seen overcome by Pleiadian science. 
The tube cars are something like our monorail systems on Earth, but 
are far more advanced and intelligent. As with other structures on 
Erra, the tubes can think and carry on a conversation with you about 
your destination, and answer any questions you may have about the 


scenery or topography of the planet. 

Billy was only able to stay on Erra for three days with Quetzal and 
found it very hard to return to Earth. Life in the Pleiades was such a 
joy to the spirit that just the thought of returning to the low 
consciousness of Earth was not very appealing. Quetzal had made it 
even harder by suggesting to Billy that he could move here with his 
family, if he liked, and leave the cares of Earth behind. This was a hard 
decision, indeed, for life on Erra was very stimulating and creative. All 
the way home Billy was thinking about it, but knew he would have to 
stay on Earth to fulfill the mission that he had put so much energy into. 

The trip back to Earth took around seven hours, giving Quetzal a 
chance to educate Billy on many other facts about his planet and its 
people. There were many similarities about Earth and Erra that were 
not accidental. After all, Earth had been originally colonized by the 
Pleiadian ancestors who had brought with them plants, animals, and 
foods from their own worlds. 0ver the past several thousand years 
Earth had become much like Erra in many ways. 

 

The Pleiades 

The Pleiades are a small cluster of stars located in the constellation of 
Taurus, the bull. During the winter months you can look to the 
Northern Hemisphere, and if you look closely, you can see six little stars in 
a small cluster that are sometimes mistakenly called the Little Dipper. 
There are actually seven stars in the Pleiades cluster, but usually only 
six are seen by the naked eye. Depending on the time of night that 
you look at them, this little cluster may look like a small saucepan with 
the handle on the left side. If this is your position, then you can move 


your eyes to the star in the top right position. It is named Taygeta and 
is the area where our visitors from the Pleiades come from. If we were 
able to fly towards Taygeta and continue on by it for several more light 
years, there would be a group of 254 blue suns. Here our ancestors 
live in a solar system much like our own. 

Much has been written about the Pleiades throughout our history. 
They are sometimes called the "Seven Sisters," or the "Daughters of 
Zeus." In the Bible they are mentioned frequently as the "Seven 
Stars." The Kiowa Indians have a folk tale that says seven Indian 
maidens were being chased by bears. The Great Spirit came to protect 
the maidens by raising a giant tower to block the bears' path. The 
bears fought to reach the escaping maidens and left the powerful claw 
marks that are seen today on the Devil's Tower n Wyoming. The young 
maidens were then placed into the sky and became the seven stars of 
the Pleiades by the Great Spirit, who protected them. 

The Pleiades also show up in ancient Egypt, for those who study the 
geometry of the Great Pyramid, Cheops, on the Gizeh Plateau. Many 
unusual mathematical coincidences present themselves, for instance, 
the rotation of our solar system around the Pleiades is 25,827.5 years. 
If you take two base diagonals of Cheops, which are 12,913.75 
pyramidal inches, and multiply them by 2, you get exactly 25,827.5. 
Is there a connection? 

TAYGETA

MEROPE 

In 1771, an astronomer named Charles Messir was the first to chart 
the sparkling Pleiades. From atop a hotel in Paris, he charted 45 stars 
in the system. The Pleiades later became designated as M45 on the 
star chart. Several other observations and mappings have been made 
since, and now it is believed that there are more than 2,300 single 
stars in the Pleiades. 

Erra, the home planet of the Pleiadians, is located in the system 
around Taygeta approximately 500 light years from Earth. It is just 
10% smaller than Earth and is rotating in a system with eight other 
planets. They now occupy four of the planets with cities and 
manufacturing. Only 400 million humans live on Erra. They have 
concluded that this is the ideal population for their world for several 
reasons. Their understanding of how the universe was created and 
how it is evolving along with the Creational Spirit has led them to 
regard planets as part of Creation that are also evolving, and they 
treat them with respect just as they do animals, trees, and all other 
forms of life in the universe. 

Population control has come about in a desire to keep their society 
spread out and sharing the resources of the planet equally. There is 
also the consideration that they like to live in connection with the 


spiritual energy produced by nature. This seems to require keeping the 
population at a certain level so as to not overpower its energy or draw 
too much from it. This is a rather refreshing attitude, since here on 
Earth the resources of our planet are considered to just be for the 
taking, and most people give the planet no consideration at all; and if 
they do, it's just thought of as some giant mud ball that we live on, 
and we can do whatever we want with it. 

Many years ago when the Pleiadians first traveled to Earth, it was 
because of the similarities of the two planets. Not only is our 
atmosphere similar, but nature is much the same on both planets as far 
as oceans, mountains, etc. Over the years the similarities are even 
closer since samples of plants, minerals, and animals have been taken 
to the Pleiades and developed there. It is for this reason that the 
Pleiadians have found the Earth very comfortable to visit. 

 

Language 

The Pleiadian language is not so dissimilar to our own as far as the 
sound and phrases. For instance, in their language an hour is called an 
odu, a day is called a musal, and a month is called an asar. It seems 
that the forefathers of the Pleiadians who visited Earth influenced our 
civilization many times in our past, and they have left behind the 
influence of their language, which has worked its way into some of the 
languages we have on Earth. For instance, citizens of Erra may pass 
each other and offer a simple greeting to one another by saying, 
Saalome, a word which means "Peace in Wisdom." In Hebrew we find 
the word Shalom, which means "peace," and is normally used as a 
greeting or farewell. This word was influenced by distant relatives of 


the Pleiadians over 9,000 years ago. 

 

Erra, the Home Planet 

The planet Erra has a green atmosphere, which they control, it 
contributes to their health and stress less way of life. They sleep only 
for hours a day because they have advanced methods of psychic control 
that induce a deep sleep quickly. Most of the food is still grown in the 
ground and is affected by their collective thoughts that control the 
digestive system, so they don't have to eat as much, and the food 
seems to last them longer. They explained that on many occasions they 
have brought foods, plants, and animals from Earth and other worlds, 
which gives them a rich selection and variety to choose from. 

They have a very high technical understanding of how food affects their 
thinking processes. They are primarily vegetarians, but sometimes 
indulge in small amounts of meat when they feel they are becoming a 
little too dreamy or light-headed. They have discovered that meat gives 
you grounding in your thinking, so they have engineered a small animal 
which looks something like a rabbit and that supplies their meat. They 
normally would not eat another living creature, so this one was chosen 
because of its low evolution. 

On a visit to Erra, we would find it to be about the same size as our 
own planet Earth, with the passing of day and night, temperature, and 
climate all very comfortable to us. As Billy experienced, even the air 
would be healthy for us. The oxygen content of the air is 32.4%, with 
traces of argon and other gases at .3%, and nitrides around 67.3%. 
Surface gravity is equal to 1.0003, just slightly higher than Earth, and 
the density is 5.521, while the inclination of the axis is 22.99 degrees. 


The diameter of the planet at the equator is 12,749 kilometers as the 
planet travels at 11.19 kilometers per second through space. They have 
a rotation of 365 1/4 days, compared with our 365-day year. A day on 
Erra is 23 hours and 59.4 seconds; which is almost the same as ours 
here on Earth. They have 13 months, with compensation every 23 
years. 

 

Living in a Parallel World 

When the ancestors of the Pleiadians, those ancient Lyran warriors led 
by Asael, were traveling through space looking for a home, an error 
was made, and their fleet slipped a part second out of normal time and 
landed in a Pleiades that is not on the same time pulse as Earth. 
Because of this, if we were to fly to the Pleiades that we see in the 
night sky, we would not find any life there, but instead an uninhabitable 
planet with a very young, blue sun. The Pleiadians live part of a second 
out of the time frame that we are in. When they come to Earth, they 
have to make a slight adjustment in their instruments to compensate 
for the difference in time in order for their Ships to be seen, or else we 
could not perceive them at all. 

The Pleiadians are far older than we are in reference to the number of 
lifetimes they have led, and they now live a more spiritual life. This 
means they are experiencing and learning more with their spiritual 
senses than with their material senses. This use of spiritual abilities 
could be, in part, how they have contributed to their long life span of 
more than 700 years. 

They are human, just like us, with few physical differences. Their skin 
is whiter than ours as a result of higher evolution. It is a natural 


function of evolution that the body material becomes less dense, with 
less pigmentation through multiple lifetimes, and the Pleiadians are 
several million years older than we are as spirit-forms. 

When they first settled on the worlds that they now live on, they were 7 
to 9 meters tall (21-27 feet). Their body size changed quickly within a 
few lifetimes because of the planet they live on, and they now are 
about the same size that we are. Their average age is now between 
700-1,000 years, mostly due to the control of spiritual energies gained 
through numerous lifetimes. 

They have no medical problems as we have, for they control health 
through psychic balance. They feel that here on Earth all of our medical 
problems are caused by illogical thinking. As we create thoughts, we 
are forming bolts of energy which have an effect on the cells in our 
body. These thought energies can be measured in polarities, such as 
positive or negative charges of electricity. If we continue with illogical 
thinking, we are creating charges of energy that depolarize the cells 
and have an effect on the performance of the individual cells, which 
leads to illness. 

It has long been known in some societies on Earth that our thoughts 
play an important part in our health and can contribute to a longer life, 
especially in the Eastern cultures where meditation is practiced as a 
means of controlling their thinking. Here in our Western culture we 
don't try to prevent illness through control of our thoughts, but instead, 
wait until the illness is obvious, and then we treat it with chemicals and 
drugs which are designed not to treat the source but to override the 
symptoms. That's why we have so few cures and recoveries from 
illness. 


The Pleiadians say they are not superhuman with the great powers that 
we may think they possess. They are men and women, like us, who 
benefit from the knowledge of many lifetimes. They are not teachers or 
missionaries and do not come on behalf of any god to give us the long-
awaited peace, as Creation does not confer any obligation on them. 
They understand our right of free will to evolve on our own, and they 
remind us that peace will come only when the people of Earth take 
responsibility for their own future and learn to create their own reality. 
Relying on or believing that someone else or some other power is going 
to bring peace will not make it happen. They feel an obligation to other 
life forms to help, but not to interfere. 

The Pleiadians are not superhuman with great powers. They are human 
beings just as we are and must constantly strive for perfection. 

 

Born in the Pleiades 

Pleiadian men and women marry and have children just like we do. 
Probably the major difference in being born in the Pleiades is that their 
understanding of the reason for a birth is different from ours, due to 
their spiritual development being so much more advanced. Here on 
Earth we are at a loss to prove the validity of reincarnation, but in the 
Pleiades it has become an exact science, allowing them to understand 
"who" is being born and what the purpose is of the coming life. 

You see, many of the more spiritually advanced leaders on Erra have 
the ability to make a spiritual connection of some kind with the 
incoming person, and "read" who they have been in the past life and 
what their purpose is or coming into this new life. A mother, for 
instance, will make a point of trying to find out what name the 


incoming person wants to call themselves, since they feel a person's 
name is an expression of not only their spiritual development, but has 
meaning relating to the path of education that they are on. They think 
of the incoming spirit-form as a person who has lived other lifetimes 
and is beginning a new one for a specific reason. Because of this, they 
are reminded that this incoming spirit-form has led many lives before 
and is now coming out of a sleep-like state to start another life. The 
idea of age means nothing when you consider that all of us have been 
young, middle-aged, and old many times before. To think that you are 
better, smarter, or somehow more advanced than someone younger 
than you is incorrect. 

When a woman becomes pregnant, she opens a "window of 
opportunity" so that a spirit-form may come back into the material life. 
The decision as to which woman the spirit-form will come into is not 
entirely up to the spirit-form, although there is a tendency for a spirit-
form to stay within the same family, if possible—which opens up the 
possibility that your great-grandfather may become the son of your 
grandchildren. Creation itself has something to do with the mechanism 
of parent selection; this process is not completely understood by the 
Pleiadians. They have advanced to a point of spiritual understanding 
and cognition that allows them to procreate or cause people to be born 
at a certain time, such as they did with the old spirit-form from Lahson, 
but they seldom do that. They are also able to contact a spirit-form 
when it is on the other side, if they want to, but do not recommend it, 
saying it is uncomfortable for the spirit-form and is not very interesting 
anyway. The spirit-form does not know any more than it did when it 
was in material life, and usually does not want to be bothered. 

Once a woman becomes pregnant, within three weeks the incoming 


spirit-form will decide whether or not to inhabit the new body that is 
being created. Abortion is allowed only during this time; this is the level 
of understanding and morality on a Pleiadian world. The mother and 
father both contribute some of their genes in forming the body for the 
incoming person. Later as the brain is forming, the incoming spirit-form 
will send impulses to signify how many brain connectors to create, so 
the "wisdom" the spirit-form is carrying from the many accumulated 
lifetimes can be handled by the brain once it is formed. Once the brain 
is developed, the spirit-form then transfers a copy of all of its wisdom 
into the acids of the brain where it will reside. 

During the following months of pregnancy, the mother will attempt to 
make spiritual contact with the incoming person to become better 
acquainted, so she will have a better understanding of how to help out 
this person with their new life. The Pleadians are able to understand, 
for instance, the path of learning that the individual is on. They can 
look into the previous lifetime and see if there are emotional 
instabilities of any kind that need to be dealt with, or if there were 
events during that life that left trauma or mental illness that should be 
addressed. They can tell if the spirit-form is happy and well-balanced, 
or plagued with hostilities and anger and what may have caused it. 
During the pregnancy, the mother will be able to learn much about the 
person coming in so that she may have a clearer understanding of how 
to assist them in their new life. 

Since Pleiadian women are not possessive of the incoming person and 
do not consider them a creation of their own, it's more like a 
partnership with another spirit-form. There is a more open attitude 
taken towards raising the child and sharing its development with others 
in the community, especially with other members of the family. This 


would seem very peculiar on Earth, since we think of our children as 
our own creations to mold in our image. How often have you seen a 
proud parent boast that his son will become a great football player, 
doctor, or work in the family business? And isn't it common for us to 
guide our children to an image that we hold of them? If we stop for an 
instant and view our children as people on a path of discovery and 
learning of their own, we might start to find some explanations for 
behavior that we are not able to understand and personality traits that 
don't make sense to us. If we recognize that these are people who lived 
lives before and have brought forward wisdom from previous lives, we 
can begin to understand why we all have different aptitudes and 
different levels of intelligence and knowledge. 

We are all on our own paths of discovery and learning, and need 
different information at different times in order to continue growing. We 
do not learn the same lessons in life at the same time, so we must 
learn to give each other space to seek out answers to questions that 
are needed for our continued spiritual growth. Life is like a school 
where we are all in different grades and different classes. 

Once the individual is born, they have the capacity to understand their 
past lives and their chosen lessons in the new life. Since the Pleiadians 
do not treat children as their own property, they give love and attention 
to all children and help each other with their educations. Newly-born 
people are helped emotionally and mentally by shielding them from the 
negative influences until they can learn to think and understand 
themselves well enough to cope. 

The first ten years of their lives are spent in education, which helps 
them gain complete understanding of whom they are and the path of 
growth that they are on. In other words, they are helped to understand 


the meaning and purpose of their life before they have to go out and 
deal with it. Only positive influences and environments are provided 
during these years, so they can become completely secure and well-
balanced within themselves, and then they are exposed to the more 
negative forces when they are better able to deal with them. 

Here on Earth there is not yet an understanding of how to communicate 
well enough with an incoming spirit-form to learn about their previous 
life, so we can't understand how to help them. We are simply born and 
thrown into a hostile world and forced to manufacture defensive 
emotions and behavior patterns to survive. Our lives on Earth are 
mostly hard and difficult, since we have no idea why we are here or 
what we are supposed to be doing, not to mention living in a civilization 
that is controlled by men of power who seek control over others, 
instead of living in a world based on love and wisdom. 

After the first ten years of self-discovery, the next seventy years of life 
in the Pleiades are spent in education; maybe up to twenty professions 
are learned. Once they leave their educational years, they work four 
hours a day and spend another four hours pursuing the proper balance 
of creativity and spiritual growth. Since Pleiadians believe the purpose 
of the material life is to gather information through the physical senses 
and then feed the spirit the wisdom learned from experience, the 
emphasis is put on personal growth and achievement, based on what is 
good for the individual. 

The basic philosophy is understanding the importance of personal 
spiritual growth by taking 100% responsibility for themselves and not 
relying on a god, myth, idol, or any other outside influence to solve 
their problems or take care of their own learning. Instead, the ability to 
communicate with higher consciousness is taught, so the individual can 


come in contact with the Creational Spirit which guides all beings in the 
universe. Only through understanding and cognition of the Laws of 
Creation can one hope to evolve to higher forms of consciousness. 

 

Economics 

The Pleiadians have no economics as we know it, but do have a system 
of sharing the resources of their world. Each person is encouraged to 
develop to their full potential, and then bring those abilities into 
society. Material possessions are all provided, based on their 
contribution to the community. They carry no coins or credit cards; as a 
matter of fact, they mentioned that we have the only paper money that 
they have ever seen. They are in contact with many worlds, but have 
not found another planet as totally engrossed in the pursuit of money 
as we are. They even observed that we use economics as a weapon; we 
actually make war with economics, instead of simply using it as a 
method of keeping score. 

On a Pleiadian planet all things are provided in their society since 
achievement for the sake of material possessions leads to greed, hate, 
and anger, and that detracts from spiritual growth. Since most of the 
citizens are telepathic, it is not possible for them to deceive or mislead 
each other, and this provides for an environment of truth and honesty 
among all. Because of this, everyone is able to share in the resources 
of their world in accordance with their contribution, without the fear of 
greed and power. This has made their life more pleasurable, and 
creates an environment where the quality of life is considerably higher. 

 

Government 


The Pleiadian civilization spent thousands of years at war, until they 
came across a race of highly developed beings in the Andromeda 
Galaxy who were in the last stages of physical life. By the calendar here 
on Earth, this would have been around the year 10 A.D. This race of 
beings was far more advanced than the Pleiadians, for they had lived 
many more lifetimes and accumulated almost total knowledge of the 
material existence and the logic of Creation. A time had come for the 
Andromedans when they evolved beyond their physical senses, and 
consequently relied solely on their spiritual consciousness for daily 
interaction. A decision was made to take the advice of these advanced 
beings and to abide by their suggestions, which led to peace and the 
end of war. 

The Pleiadians now have a High Council composed of the more 
spiritually advanced, who interpret the wisdom from the Andromeda 
beings and spread the information to all four of their planets. All 
citizens in the Pleiades take part in the decisions that are made which 
make the laws by which they live. This is done through a system of 
voting similar to ours, only it takes a very high percentage of the voting 
public to agree before anything is passed. In some cases everyone 
must agree before a change is made. This is done to encourage a 
feeling of unity and peace, and to take into consideration the views of 
everyone before making changes. 

The Pleiadians are a member of an alliance of civilizations that take 
advice from the beings from Andromeda. This includes thousands of 
different societies scattered all over the Andromeda Galaxy and our 
own Milky Way, creating a total population of about 127 billion people. 
Not all developed races belong to this alliance, but those who do adhere 
to certain rules governing civilizations such as ours. 


In the Pleiades, each planet governs itself in a unitary type system but 
is subordinate to the High Council, which is located on Erra and is the 
central government. The Council is comprised of half-spiritual and half-
material or semi-spiritual/semi-material creatures, which are human 
forms of life with enormous knowledge. It is the High Council's function 
to be in contact with very high pure-spiritual forms for advice, which is 
impossible for pure-material forms of life because the energy 
oscillations of the spiritual spheres arc too high for the average 
Pleiadian. 

They belong to an alliance, including races from a neighboring universe 
called the Dal Universe, which tries to regulate peace in certain areas of 
the universe through the use of giant spacecraft. The patrols that watch 
over Earth report that there are many space travelers who visit here. 
Each year around 3,000 ships enter our atmosphere, but only a small 
percentage are interested in making contact, and then it is usually only 
telepathic. As of 1976, the Pleiadians stated that were seven other 
races besides themselves that maintained bases here on Earth. 

 

Alliance with Earth 

We are told that the Pleiadians abide by rules that do not allow them to 
interfere in our political or power structures here on Earth, provided 
that we are confined to our own solar system. Once we have the 
technical ability to leave our solar system under our own power and 
move out into free space, then we will come in contact with other 
races, including the Pleiadians, who will try to influence us. They want 
to make it clear that we, the people of Earth, must be very careful to 
whom we align ourselves, for there are many races out there who are 


very barbaric and would take us over in a minute or destroy us 
altogether. They hope that we may choose to align ourselves with them 
and other peaceful races, but the time is rapidly approaching that we 
may have to defend ourselves from an attack from space, for Earth is 
very well known in this area of the galaxy. The Pleiadians afford us 
some measure of protection by making their presence known to 
incoming ships through a network that surrounds our planet, but it is 
not clear to what extent they would go to defend us from invasion. 

Occasionally ships piloted by dangerous races come into Earth 
space and take humans for experiments. 

 

Love and Marriage 

Pleiadians fall in love, marry, create families, and raise children just as 
we do. Although nothing is known about the marriage ceremony, we 
have been told that multiple marriages are common. It is quite normal 
for Pleiadians to be involved in two or three marriages at the same 
time. This system seems to work quite well for them, due to an 
emotional stability in their society that has all but eliminated jealousy 
and possessiveness. Families will generally live on the same land but in 
different houses, while the responsibility for raising children is shared 
by all. 

Divorce is not allowed because they feel this is an offense against the 
Laws of Creation. If the marriage laws are broken, the partners are 
exiled from the planet, but this rarely happens. They believe in many 
kinds of love, especially in friendship and marriage which are very 
closely related, as well as the love of all creatures. 

If the rare case happened that a Pleiadian chose to marry someone 


from another race less spiritually evolved than themselves, then it is 
provided that the spiritual evolution of the less-evolved life form could 
be accelerates to meet the evolved level of the partner. This is done 
through a transplant of brain acids that contain the evolutionary 
wisdom of the higher-evolved individual which can be put into the 
lower-evolved life form, causing a rapid increase in their development. 
Apparently, this process works quite well and becomes a permanent 
part of the evolution of the recipient life form. 

 

Landing on the White House Lawn 

There is no plan to land on the White House lawn. The Pleadians have 
listened to the thoughts of most world leaders and believe that all 
Earthly governments are only interested in power and control, and have 
little interest in anything else. An examination of the thoughts of our 
leaders shows them all to be power-crazy individuals who look at 
extraterrestrials as a source of power to conquer the cosmos when, in 
fact, they cannot even create peace on their own world. 

A possible meeting was once discussed with certain officials of the 
American Government, and the Pleiadians agreed to meet with a small 
group. As the Pleiadians listened to the thoughts of the officials who 
were planning the meeting, it was discovered that the officials were 
planning to kill them at the meeting sight so that they could obtain the 
Beamship the Pleiadians came in. This sort of thinking has led the 
Pleiadians to having no trust of our officials, thereby making any sort of 
commerce with us almost impossible. It is estimated that it may be 
around 300 years before any kind of social contact may be possible 
with us, due to the enormous gap in our spiritual and moral 


understandings. It simply isn't in their interest. 

 

Open Contact 

The Pleiadians are still here on Earth and occasionally visit Billy and 
others whom they are interested in, but we have not reached a time of 
public awareness and open contact as a society. It's very exciting to 
think that this may be a possibility within a few years. For me, and for 
many of you, the ability to go and visit a civilization on another planet 
is a very exciting idea. To visit another world and see how they live 
would be a dream come true. Being exposed to so many new ideas, 
experiences, and so much knowledge would probably be overwhelming. 
It would certainly be hard to return to Earth after experiencing the 
consciousness of a higher-developed society. When this does happen 
and some of us get to visit the Pleiades and return to tell of our 
experiences like Billy did, the Earth will forever change and leave 
behind its adolescence. The paradigms that hold our society together 
will vanish and be replaced with new concepts and ideas that will leave 
a great mark in history. 

 

The Beamships 

Photo Proofs 

Over a two-year period, Semjase allowed Billy to take hundreds of 
photos of her spacecraft. She did this purposely as a method of proof 
to awaken the minds of Earthmen to the idea that they are not alone. 
Over the years millions of people have looked at Billy's beautiful 
pictures and felt something stir inside of them. To some people it 
brings on feelings of familiarity or just the excitement of knowing 


someone is out there. In any case, there is no question that Semjase's 
decision to let her ship be photographed has gone a long way in 
opening up the minds of many people on Earth. 

 

Silvano Sees a Ship 

Since Billy had been allowed to take photos of the Pleiadian 
Beamships, I was curious if any of the other F.I.G.U. members had 
ever taken any Billy had over a thousand pictures that he shot over a 
two-year period. It seemed likely that some of the others around the 
Center might have had an opportunity to take some also. 

I spent most of my mornings helping out around the farm. It was 
great exercise and gave me a chance to somewhat earn my keep. The 
work around the Center was organized by a fellow named Silvano. He 
was a young man who had brought his wife and baby to the Center to 
learn about Billy’s contacts. He had decided to stay on for awhile to 
learn what he could, working the farm in exchange for his room and 
board. I had spent a lot of time with Silvano over the past few weeks 
and, of course, we had spent many hours discussing the Pleiadian 
material. 

Silvano was a very kind and friendly person. He had a big smile and 
open face that let you know immediately that you were welcome in his 
life. His sensitive nature and his inquisitive mind had led him to Billy 
to discover what he could about the messages from the stars. In this 
respect we had a lot in common. I asked him if he had ever taken any 
pictures of the Pleiadian Beamships, and he remarked that he hadn't. 
He had seen them, but didn't have a camera with him at the time. It 
had happened on a clear, sunny afternoon, just as he had finished 


some of his chores and was cleaning up in the kitchen. He was washing 
his hands in the sink and glanced out of the window that offered a view 
of the large valley that spread out next to the Center. At first he 
thought the light was playing tricks on his eyes, because a flash of 
silver was dancing in the sunlight about a mile away. Catching his 
attention, the silver flash began to move slowly across the valley as he 
closely watched through the window. 

Silvano quickly moved from the sink and out the back door to get a 
better look. The silver object had moved in closer, and he could clearly 
make it out. It was a round, silver Beamship, just like the ones in the 
photos Billy had taken. It suddenly changed directions a couple of times 
as it quietly flew over the trees. Then with a quick move it came closer, 
stopped, and hovered in the air. It was gently rocking like a boat in the 
water, an action that Billy had described several times himself. Then 
without making a sound, it suddenly just blinked out of sight and 
disappeared. Silvano was just left standing there with a big smile on his 
face. He had been at the Center for over a year, and now he had seen 
real proof of the existence of the Pleiadian Beamships. 

 

A Birthday Party 

I had become pretty good friends with a lady named Bruni, who was 
kind enough to spend many of her evenings with me answering all of 
my questions. She had moved to Switzerland from Germany with her 
son to also learn from Billy. I told her about some of the experiences 
that Silvano had, seeing the Pleiadian Beamships, and wondered if 
Bruni had seen them as well. She remarked that she had seen them on 
several occasions, but remembered her first experience more vividly 


than the others. 

It was on February 3rd, 1984, Billy's birthday. Bruni had just become a 
member of the F.I.G.U. and had only been at the Center for a couple of 
weeks. Since she had a son and a job in a neighboring city, she had 
taken an apartment in the nearby town of Wila in order to be close to 
the Center and her work. In honor of Billy's birthday, she had gone to 
the Center to have dinner with the rest of the group. They were all 
sitting around the kitchen table when all of a sudden Billy straightened 
up in his chair, his soft blue eyes becoming brighter, as if something 
was happening to him. Bruni couldn't help notice the change and was 
just staring at him. Someone mentioned that this was common when he 
was receiving a telepathic message from the Pleiadians. Apparently, he 
was about to have a contact. Popi, Billy's wife, had gotten him his coat; 
after all, it was wintertime and very cold in Switzerland. As soon as 
Billy was dressed, he walked to the back door of the kitchen, adjusted 
his coat, and walked out the door. Bruni was naturally very excited by 
all this and rushed over to the window to see what was going on. By 
the time she reached the window, Billy was nowhere in sight. He had 
vanished without leaving a footstep in the snow. Bruni was very excited 
but was soon calmed by the others, who had become accustomed to 
this sort of thing. 

It was only a few minutes later when suddenly Billy reappeared from 
the living room. He didn't appear cold, his jacket was undone, and 
there was no snow on his boots. Billy informed everyone that he had 
been gone for a couple of hours. It seems that Semjase had come to 
see him on his birthday. Even though he had been in the ship with her 
for a couple of hours, she had shifted time and returned him about ten 
minutes after he left so as to not to spoil the family party in the 


kitchen. Bruni was quite excited to have witnessed this event, which 
cleared any doubts she may have had about Billy's experiences. 

Bruni said that she often sees the Pleiadian Beamships in the sky 
around the Center. It is not uncommon to see them late at night, 
simply flying by as if to say hello. Since I seemed so interested, she 
produced a photo album that contained many photos of the alien crafts. 
These had all been taken by Billy on different occasions. The intriguing 
part was that many of these photos have not been seen before by the 
public. 

One fascinating photo was of a Beamship that Bruni called the "wedding 
cake" ship. It was a new experimental design with some kind of round 
metal balls all over it. It did look a little like a wedding cake. I had seen 
one picture of this ship in America, but here were over a dozen photos 
of this strange craft in trees, over vans, and on the ground in front of 
the farmhouse. One special picture that caught my eye had been taken 
right over the van that I was living in behind the main house at the 
Center. 

Another shot that fascinated me had been taken of the ship as it was 
hovering a few feet off the ground among many trees. The size of the 
ship was obvious in comparison to the surrounding trees. It also looked 
very alien compared to the normal saucer-like ships. Bruni explained 
that the Pleiadians allowed Billy to take pictures of the older saucer-like 
ships, since that image was more comfortable to most of us and would 
not cause as much fear. 

The next day at the Center I saw Billy and asked if I could get copies of 
some of the photos for myself. He was happy to oblige and suggested 
that I look through all of the photo albums. There were around 1,100 


photos in very large albums. They were all numbered, so I could easily 
identify which ones I wanted. I picked out about a dozen that caught 
my eye, and later that afternoon Popi gave me the copies. 

I think that was the day that I started staring at the sky a lot. I had a 
camera with me and became a little excited about the idea of capturing 
a photo myself. I realized that it had been several years since the 
physical contacts had stopped, but if they still came by for an 
occasional hello, perhaps I could get it on film. I asked Billy if he knew 
when they might be coming by, for I would very much like to see one 
for myself. He just smiled and nodded his head. 

 

The Pleiadian Beamships 

On Earth when we see a strange object in our skies, we call it a UFO or 
flying saucer. UFO stands for Unidentified Flying Object, but we may 
have to coin a new phrase now that we are in contact with the 
Pleiadians and know where they come from. Perhaps we could call them 
IFOs, for Identified Flying Object. The Pleiadians, however, call their 
small ships Beamships. The name comes from one of the first drive 
systems they developed, which relied on a light-emitting device to 
create power, hence the name Beamship. The ships are equipped with 
two drive systems, one for speeds up to the speed of light and another 
for beyond the light barrier. 

A Beamship is a small spacecraft capable of carrying three passengers 
from one place in the galaxy to another. It is a very common way to 
travel for the citizens of the Pleiades. Many different sizes and shapes 
are made, depending on the intended use. The saucer shape that is 
often seen on Earth is used on planets where there is an atmosphere or 


water. Giant ships of unusual shapes are also used to house and 
transport large numbers of Pleiadians in open space. 

The Pleiadians allowed photographs of the Beamships to be made 
purposely. They are aware that a great number of people on Earth have 
lived previous lives where the Beamship technology was used. Because 
of this, when we see the photos, most of us will not be afraid. For many 
people the sight of the Beamship may actually seem familiar and jar 
some old memories. At any rate, the design of the ship will seem 
nonthreatening and comfortable to most of us, and provide a level of 
proof that life on other worlds does exist. 

Beamships are seven meters (21 feet) in diameter, carrying a crew of 
three and have interplanetary capabilities. They are most commonly 
used for short trips around planetary systems because of their small 
interior. If longer trips are required or more passengers need to be 
transported, then large ships that are more comfortable are used. The 
Beamships weigh only 1.5 tons and do not have time-travel capabilities, 
like some of their other designs. 

The engines use an implosion type of system, rather than explosion, 
causing matter to be converted back into something useful. The energy 
of the ship goes out the bottom of the ship and is reclaimed at the top. 
As it moves around the ship, it seems to distort all that is around it, 
causing the trees and all the surroundings to bend and distort. The field 
of energy around the ship causes the bottom to appear blue in color. 
Some of the distortion is caused by the energy screens that are 
projected by the ship for protection. 

Beamships are used like we use cars. They are usually made for 
the individual and are connected to their thinking through organic 


intelligence. 

Pictures of the ship are only possible when they allow it, for the screens 
of the ships can also control the line of vision. In many of the photos 
the Beamship was over a house or small community while the pictures 
were being taken, but no one could see the craft. 

The antennae guide-beam on top of the ship is used to detect different 
kinds of energy. As an example, on one occasion the Pleiadians asked 
for some photos that had been taken of the ship, which included the 
antennae on top of the craft. They wanted the negatives and the 
camera for awhile because they wanted to see how sensitive the film 
was to picking up the energies. An examination of the film by the 
Pleiadians revealed the energies from Saturn around the antennae as 
they had suspected. Billy was told that these energies would have an 
effect on our thoughts, causing many people on Earth to be grumpy or 
moody for the next few months. This strange energy would also cause 
the magnetic energy created by the ship's drive systems to be visible to 
the naked eye for the same period. 

The inside of the ship has three seats that fold out into sleeping 
couches. Most of the console of the ship is filled with different kinds of 
screens for obtaining information. There is a greenish-yellow light 
inside the ship that is generated by the windows, and they appear 
orange on the outside. Those windows are intelligent and control the 
ability to leave the ship. If the atmosphere outside is hostile, the 
windows will sense it and not allow the "pit" of the ship to open without 
the person wearing protective clothing. As the ship leaves the 
atmosphere, the color of the windows becomes clear. The shape of the 
ship is designed for the least resistance in an atmosphere and provides 
the largest surface area to enable the drive system to be the most 


effective. The ships are protected by an energy force field that allows 
the atmosphere to glide away instead of pushing against it. This 
protection field must be designed in such a way that it gives a little so 
as to not create resistance or else it will slow down the ship, keeping it 
from reaching the speeds it must attain for travel. The protection field 
also neutralizes the attractive force of our planet. They are, in a sense, 
diverting gravity. The ship then acts as a planet itself, with its own 
gravitational force. The clothing that they wear can create the same 
effect as the protection girdle on the ships. They are worn outside the 
ship when on hostile planets. There is no feeling of movement inside 
the ship when it is flying, for it creates its own specific gravity and 
protects the inhabitants from any outside forces. Even when the ship is 
making sharp turns at tremendous speeds, there is no awareness of 
movement. 

There are many different types of information screens built into the 
consoles of the ship. They can be used for information about flight, 
planes, and life forms. The screens can be telepathically controlled like 
many of the functions of the ship and can display important information 
about any kind of life form, such as the time of birth and the expected 
length of an individual's life span. It can also be used to interpret the 
thoughts and feelings of an individual. 

The trip from Erra, the Pleiadian home planet, takes seven hours to 
reach Earth; they feel this is a long time to travel in a small ship. The 
total distance from Erra to Earth is around 500 light years, which is a 
considerable distance. Here on Earth we are used to measuring things 
in miles. For instance, it is approximately 400 miles from Los Angeles 
to San Francisco by car. If we drove that distance, it would take us 
about 7 hours, traveling at a speed of 55 miles per hour. This is the 


same amount of time it takes a Beamship to travel 500 light years from 
the Pleiades. We can envision the distance from Los Angeles to San 
Francisco since it is familiar to most of us, but a light year, how far is 
that? 

Light travels at the speed of 186,000 miles in one second, not an hour. 
That means that if we multiply the speed of light times 60, we get 
11,160,000 miles in a minute. And then multiply by another 60, and we 
get 669,600,000 miles in an hour. A light year is the distance that light 
will travel in one year's time, which is 5,865,696,000,000 miles. (That’s 
5 trillion, 865 billion, 696 million miles.) That's so fast that our minds 
have nothing to relate it to. Here's an example that may help. It is 
approximately 24,000 miles around the Earth. If we used a flashlight as 
a light source and shined it due east, the light would travel around the 
Earth 7.75 times in one second. The light from the sun takes 8.3 
minutes to travel 93,000,000 miles to Earth before it hits our eyes. 
Even if we could travel at the speed of light in a Beamship, theoretically 
it would still take us 500 years to get to the Pleiades. How then, are 
they able to get here in only 7 hours? 

The answer lies in the fact that Beamships do not fly at the speed of 
light, but have the technology to convert themselves into fine-matter 
particles that can travel faster than the speed of light. This is possible 
by traveling through what is called hyperspace, thereby making it 
possible to travel billions of miles in just part of a second. In order to 
understand this, a brief explanation of time and space is necessary, 
which will make all of this clearer. 

You and I live in a three-dimensional world of planets, suns, and 
galaxies. It is a material place that we can see and touch. The 
Pleiadians call it the coarse-matter world since it is material and 


appears solid. 

Time is energy. It cannot be seen, but it is energy that causes the 
rotation and movement of the three-dimensional world we live in. It is 
a wave of pulse energy that moves through all matter, causing 
rotation, movement, and pulsation. Time controls the normal speed of 
all matter until something comes along and changes it. Time is 
considered fine-matter since it is not solid and exists only in an energy 
form. Without time, space would stop moving. 

So we live in a space that is affected by the energy of time. The space 
we live in is comprised of different kinds of matter: carbon, hydrogen, 
zinc, and the other elements that make up all of the matter in our 
three-dimensional space. But the universe has other dimensions that 
do not contain the same matter as the three-dimensional part we live 
in. Hyperspace is one of these areas. Here, there are different kinds of 
energy particles that are moving at much higher speeds because time 
is different, and time does not exist in hyperspace the same as it does 
in our dimensions. 

The Beamships have the technology to move themselves into 
hyperspace and convert themselves into high-speed particles that 
exist there. They then can travel much faster, going billions of miles in 
a part of a second. Once they arrive at their destination, they then 
reenter normal space and convert themselves back into their original 
form. The time in hyperspace seems instantaneous, and the 
passengers will have no awareness of what has happened. 

Let's say we have borrowed a Beamship and have decided to travel to 
the Pleiades. We don't know how to fly it, so we follow a manual of 
instructions to guide us through the procedure. We leave Earth at 


12:00 noon for the Pleiades and begin to fly out of our solar system. 
The manual tells us how to set the proper coordinates, so we are 
going in the right direction. We begin to travel at several million miles 
per hour and are gaining speed as we go. As we speed up, we begin to 
feel sick; something is wrong, so we refer to the manual. It says that 
we are suffering from the effects of the mass speed correlation. What 
is that, and how do we solve it? The problem is that as we accelerate 
in speed, our bodies are increasing in mass and we are becoming 
dysfunctional. If this continues, we will die.

If you are in a car traveling down the highway and put your hand out 
the window, you can feel the resistance of the wind, can't you? Air is 
very powerful, indeed. If you go fast enough, you can catch enough of 
it with a wing to fly through the air in an airplane. In other words, air is 


slowly developing into a mass of resistance. In space there is no air, but 
there is mass. When you go fast enough, the mass of space will build up just 
like the wind, and you have resistance. If you continue to go even faster, 
the mass builds up around your body and crushes you. So the mass speed 
correlation means that as we increase in speed, there is a build-up of mass 
that will destroy us and the ship if we continue. So how do we protect 
ourselves? 

The manual says to turn on the protective energy screens that surround the 
Beamship, and we will be protected from the mass speed correlation. These 
energy screens surround the Beamship and isolate the ship from the mass 
of space. This bubble will also protect us from any debris we may run into in 
space. Energy screens also form artificial gravity, so now we are traveling in 
a Beamship which is surrounded by a protective field of energy that creates 
gravity. Inside of the ship we have created a mini-world with our own 
specific gravitational field, so we are separated from any force of energy 
outside of the ship. This enables our craft to make any changes in course, 
and we will have no feeling of it. We are only aware of the gravitational field 
inside of the ship. We are protected from the mass of space. It feels just like 
being on the ground, with no sensation of movement. 

Now that the screens have been turned on, we are feeling better and 
continue the trip. Soon we notice that we are traveling at almost the speed 
of light, we will soon make the change into hyperspace and reappear in the 
Pleiades. The manual says we must wait until we are 153,000,001 
kilometers (94 million miles) past the last planet's orbit in our solar 
system before making the move into hyperspace. This is a safety 
precaution since the changeover into hyperspace creates a rip, or small 
tear, in time and can sometimes pull objects other than the Beamship 
in with it. It is also possible to cause a disturbance in the orbit of 


planets if we are too close. 0ur instruments tell us that we are 
approaching the safety distance, so we can get ready to make the move 
into hyperspace. We have been traveling for 3 1/2 hours. The time is 
3:30 on our watches. 

Fortunately for us, it says in the manual that the process of moving into 
hyperspace is automated, so there is nothing for us to do. It even 
mentions that we won't feel anything during the change. As the ship 
approaches light speed, we can tell by our instruments that the screens 
are holding back tremendous energy. If they should fail, we would be 
crushed instantly from the incredible mass pressing against our 
protective energy screens. It takes tremendous amount of energy for 
the solid matter of the ship and its passengers to be converted into 
fine-matter that can move in hyperspace. The Pleiadians have 
developed a technology that uses the tremendous pressure of the mass 
of space that is pressing in on us as a force to make the conversion 

The first step in moving the Beamship into hyperspace is to turn off the 
protective screens, which immediately causes an enlargement of the 
mass. The tremendous energy that is rushing in on the ship is used to 
facilitate the changing of the matter of the Beamship into fine-matter 
energy. We are no longer in our material form but have been 
converted, along with the ship, into a different form of energy that can 
exist in another dimension, which is called hyperspace. We have 
created a distortion of time and dematerialize ourselves. 

At the exact moment that we are converted, we must make the move 
into hyperspace, for if we don't, there will be a catastrophe. We have 
just been' converted into particles of fine-matter energy that exists in 
hyperspace, but we are still in our normal three-dimensional world. In 
order to make the move into hyperspace, a dilation of time is caused. 


The theory of relativity goes only to a certain point here. At the exact 
moment of the dilation of time, the breaking open of hyperspace occurs 
and the ship and crew, in their new form, move into hyperspace (also 
called null-time). 

In hyperspace we are moving so fast that we appear paralyzed relative 
to the normal world. We can cross the 500 light years of distance to the 
Pleiades in a millionth of a second. The wonderful technology of the 
Pleiadians understands how to guide us in hyperspace and how to 
return s to the normal three-dimensional world at the right location. 
This is done by reversing the process that put us in hyperspace, 
causing us to leave this null-time dimension and causing a dilation in time 
again, whereby we are re-formed back into our normal state. Within a 
millionth of a second we find ourselves outside of the Pleiadian Solar 
System by a safe distance of 153,000,000 kilometers, or 94 million miles. 

A glance at our watch shows it is still 3:30; our time in hyperspace was so 
short that we were not aware of any time passing. The whole process takes 
no more than a millionth part of a second. To our surprise, we didn't feel 
anything. We were out of our bodies for part of a second, though. We were 
not in material form but were, indeed, in an energy state while in 
hyperspace; it happened so fast that our material bodies didn't even 
remember being gone. 

It will now take us another 3 1/2 hours to fly into the solar system of 
Taygeta and land on the planet Erra in the Pleiades. When we get there, it 
will be 7:00 on our watches, for we will have taken seven hours to get 
there. Thanks to the technology of the Pleiadians, everything went well and 
we made it safely to our destination. 

Things don't always go well, though, as this is very difficult technology to 


understand and even harder to put into use. While we were in hyperspace, 
we could have slipped in time and been lost forever. This is caused by the 
change in speed of our fine-matter energy particles while in hyperspace. If 
the speed of our fine-matter energy form had accelerated relative to the 
flow of time in hyperspace, we would have slipped millions of years into the 
future. If our speed had retarded, we would have fallen back into the past. 
A single second in the hyperspace equals millions of years in normal space. 
This means that if our speed had not remained constant for the part of a 
second that we were in hyperspace, we would have returned to our normal 
space and would have been millions or even billions of years out of time. 

It is possible to remain in hyperspace for longer periods of time to cross 
greater distances, but the technology to control the speed while in the fine-
matter state is critical. Most races experience difficulty with this process, 
including many of our forefathers who have had to fight these same 
problems and are now lost in time forever. Many time travelers are stuck 
here on Earth. The dangers of speed are great, and their effects occur at 
even a few miles per hour. Even in our airplanes we are increasing mass 
and dissolving matter, but because of the slow speed, the effects take a 
long time, possibly hundreds of years. At high speeds it is reduced to 
decades or even a few years. As the speed increases, the danger of our 
thought patterns being damaged increases. 

 

The Metal of the Beamships 

The metal used in the ships is a soft metal which is a combination of 
materials from lead contained in the atmospheres of stars. Some of it 
is found in water, some from different plants, as well as different ores 
from stars in stages of destruction. They then convert the lead 


substances they have assembled into this soft metal and treat it with 
chemicals to make it hard; then it undergoes another process, which 
they are not allowed o disclose, in order to make the metal suitable 
for Beamships. The final product is an alloy which is basically a 
copper-nickel-silver alloy and also contains gold for certain Beamships. 

We could not produce the alloy on Earth, since not all of the 
ingredients are available here. For the most part, the chart of 
elements is the same throughout the universe, so you can find the 
same metals wherever there are planets that support them. We have 
most of them on Earth, but not all. Evan though we could produce the 
alloy from our known metals, it would not be the same. We must first 
develop space travel in order to get to outer space to find some of the 
components in stars and giant gas planets where metals of greater 
density exist. 

Some of the technology to make the metal of a Beamship will be 
discovered in the giant gas planets of Jupiter and Saturn. 

 

You Can't Steal a Beamship It Dissolves! 

A special form of intelligence is put into the cell structure of the metal 
that the Pleiadian Beamships are made of. This is done for the 
protection of the craft in case it is stolen. Once the Beamship is 
separated from its owner, a special coding in the metal causes it to 
begin to dissolve and break down. This was demonstrated by 
furnishing a small piece of metal from the ship to Billy. He took it 
home and placed it on the kitchen table to see what would happen. 
Within 24 hours of being removed from the ship, the metal had 
deteriorated into dust. 


Stealing a Beamship would be almost impossible anyway, since the 
onboard computers are organic and capable of highly intelligent 
thought. They operate with a very high state of artificial intelligence 
that not only performs most of the tasks on board the ship, but will 
protect the pilot when outside the ship. The concept of computer chips 
and wiring that are used on Earth for our modern-day computers has 
been vastly improved on by the Pleiadians to a state of organically-
grown intelligence that can communicate, think, and run the processes 
of the ship. If this concept seems hard to believe then reflect for a 
moment on the idea that only a hundred years ago we were crossing 
America in covered wagons and riding on horseback. Imagine how 
much we will advance over the next thousand years. 

 

Gravity 

Gravity is of electromagnetic nature with two unitary but contrary forces. 
It works to attract as well as to repulse and is connected to the mass 
itself. The Earth exercises the coherent, and the second factor is itself the 
generation and use of what we call gravity. Gravity and electromagnetism 
exist at the same time and appear as attraction and repulsion. One of the 
contributing factors for the development of gravity is the warmth of the 
planet and the cold of the cosmos, the solid center of the planet and the 
atmosphere. These factors are important for the development of the 
gravity and the force of anti-gravity, which varies at different points on 
the Earth. 

 

Telemeter Ships 

The Pleiadians have small reconnaissance ships called telemeter ships, 


which are used to gather information about us. Most of these ships are 
unmanned and range from nine feet in diameter to small basketball-size 
devices. They are normally controlled by radio-type signals that are 
broadcast from their underground complex. Some of the telemeter ships 
also have on-board intelligence and can pilot themselves and make 
decision on their own. All of the little reconnaissance ships can be directed 
and influenced by telepathy. 

The nine-foot version has room for one passenger and can be flown 
manually if need be. The telemeter ships are used mostly to monitor all of 
our different languages, for this is a particularly interesting study for 
them. They have recorded all of the languages that have been spoken on 
our world for thousands of years, and continue to monitor our thinking 
processes to better understand the logic of why we live the way we do. It 
is very puzzling to them, for instance, how we can live in such a corrupt 
and negative environment and yet do nothing about it. 

Communication on the ships is by a process similar to our radio, but the 
signal travels in a different manner. The signal is attached to faster-than-
light particles called tachyons and is projected through null-time, so it 
arrives at its destination almost instantly. In this way messages and 
signals can be sent across vast distances of space and be received very 
quickly. 

 

"Beam Me Up, Scotty" 

We have all watched Star Trek as the captain and crew are beamed down 
to a planet below from the transporter room. A very similar process is 
used to bring people up into the Beamship. Special matter converters 
onboard the ship can break the matter of the body down into fine-


matter, and then reassemble it inside the ship. In the case of Billy's 
contacts, the Beamship would usually position itself overhead, perhaps 
as high as 3,000 feet, and then within an instant he would find himself 
standing inside of the "pit" of the ship. There is no discomfort or feeling 
of any kind. It is also possible to lift someone up into the ship by using 
an antigravity type of device in which they are very slowly raised up 
through the air. 

 

The Wedding Cake Ship 

In 1981 the Pleiadians were working with a new technology and had 
designed a special kind of ship that operated on a different scientific 
principle. It was designed with a special drive system that did not 
necessitate speeding up to tremendous speeds to make the hyperspace 
jump possible, like in the little Beamship, but instead could make the 
jumps while almost standing still. Because of its unusual design, it has 
often been called the wedding cake ship, for it is round and has a ring 
of small metal balls around the ship, giving it the appearance of a 
decorated wedding cake. 

A race of people who are friendly with the Pleiadians, called Timers 
(pronounced Tim-mers), had discovered long ago that within the three-
dimensional part of a galaxy there existed corridors or canals where 
material particles could not exist. These canals were out of normal 
space and time and could be entered at slow speeds. Once the 
technology was worked out on how to find the canals and enter them, 
the ship could move within that galaxy and re-enter the material realm 
at almost any point within the same galaxy, and very little time at all 
would have passed. The way it looked in the material dimension was 


that the ship would simply blink out as it entered these null-time 
canals, and seemingly blink back in when it reentered. The canals only 
exist within a galaxy, limiting the distance of the jumps, for there is a 
field of energy that forms around a galaxy that is used to facilitate this 
process, and this doesn't work in free space between galaxies. 

This means that unlike a Beamship, which has to move 94 million miles 
out into space before moving into hyperspace, this new craft can simply 
dematerialize and move itself into these canals and "jump" to where it 
wants to go, a much faster process that appears almost magical. This 
new process was just being learned by the Pleiadians, who understood 
very little about it, but could at least build and operate the drive 
systems that had been designed for them by the Timers. The 
technology had been used to build a very large Mothership, but this 
was the first time it had been tried in a smaller vehicle. The test ship 
appears in the photos taken by Billy to be smaller than the normal 
Beamship. From my knowledge of the surroundings where the photos 
were taken, I would estimate that the ship was only about 12 to 15 feet 
in diameter. Billy only saw the ship on one occasion, but was allowed to 
take photos and a movie film of this experimental ship in 1981. This was the 
last time he ever saw the wedding cake ship, and these were the last photos 
taken of any Pleiadian craft. 


 mothership.jpg


The Pleiadian Mothership is shaped like a large egg. This is the first of its 
kind in the Pleiadian fleet. 

 

The Mothership 

The technology for the wedding cake ship was downsized from the design 
for the largest and newest spacecraft built by the Pleiadians. A product of 
information provided by the Timers, this large galaxy-class ship measures 
17,182 meters, or almost ten miles, in diameter. It was assembled in space 
and is not designed to be used in a planetary atmosphere. It represents a 
major breakthrough for the Pleiadians, for it is the first ship of its kind that 
can bridge the gap between universes. On Earth we would term this giant 
spacecraft a Mothership. The main part of the ship looks like a large egg 
standing on end, while on the bottom there are three smaller, round 
sections that are interconnected by huge braces. The three smaller sections 


have another brace extending out of the top and hooking into the main part 
of the ship above them. One of the round objects provides a hatch, or 
hanger, where visitors can store their smaller craft while they are onboard 
the huge city. 

This is a completely self-contained world capable of providing a home for 
more than 140,000 people who live onboard. Most of these people enjoy 
living in space and very seldom return to the home planet. Everything is 
provided for here, including a large area constructed to duplicate the outside 
conditions found on a planet, such as gardens, lakes, and small 
mountains so that the inhabitants can commune with nature. Living 
quarters, school, manufacturing facilities, virtually everything that is 
needed to sustain life s onboard, for the great ship has been designed 
to be a complete living situation for its crew and is completely self-
sustaining. 

Since the population was so large, they designed huge airways that 
connected the different parts of the craft in order to move people 
around the ship. These airways run inside of the huge braces that hook 
the three smaller sections of the ship to the main body. This allows 
passengers to easily move from one area of the ship to another. The 
largest airway extends all the way up the middle of the main part of the 
craft. This giant open airway allows access to any level of the ship on 
small floating platforms that are used to move people up and down the 
airways and make it easy to get around. 

The air inside of the great Mothership contains not only a higher 
content of oxygen than on Earth, but other elements have also been 
added that reduce the need for sleep and keep the occupants awake 
longer. It is very similar to the atmosphere on their home planets. 
Along with the air, another consideration is the food. Just like on the 


surface world, the crew of this great ship eat a very light diet of 
vegetables and fruits. They have engineered the food so that by simply 
munching on small amounts of these special y grown fruits and 
vegetables, they can reduce the need for sleep to as little as only four 
hours per day, while hunger can be calmed for as long as 90 hours, if 
necessary. 

The Command Center for the great Mothership is located at the top of 
the main body of the ship and is where everything is controlled. Here 
hundreds of Pleiadians and androids assist in the control of the ship. 
The androids are created organically by their scientists to do specific 
tasks. They do not have a spirit as humans do, but are programmed 
with tremendous intelligence to do certain functions. Most of the 
functions of running the ships are done by androids, since they are very 
well-suited for this kind of work. They can stay alive for long periods of 
time, are disease-free, and can be programmed for any kind of work, 
personality, and character. They are used extensively all throughout 
the Pleiadian society to handle most of the manual labor and technical 
work because they can be programmed with very advanced intelligence. 
The androids do not contain computers as we know them, but their 
brains would be an extension of the idea of a computer and are 
organically made from human material grown by their scientists. For 
spiritual reasons the Pleiadians do not believe in the idea of cloning, so 
they have instead advanced the concept of a computer into this level of 
technology. 

You can see right through the ceiling of the Command Center. Even -
though it is solid, you can see the stars overhead as if you were 
outside. They have a way of projecting some kind of radiation beam at 
the ceiling so t' at you can see through it, causing it to appear invisible. 


This way everyone working at the Command Center can see exactly 
where they are and where they are going, not to mention that the view is 
spectacular. 

Visitors from many parts of the universe come together on this great 
craft, so communication would be a problem without the special language 
converters that are worn. It can read your mind and pick up your 
thoughts just before you speak. It then creates the words you need to say 
in the language you have selected, and causes you to speak it. When you 
normally learn a language, you practice for weeks and build your 
vocabulary and learn all the grammar. The converter already knows the 
language, so it only has to know what you want to say, and then it feeds 
your mind the knowledge of the language you have selected, and you can 
speak it. It contains the knowledge of thousands of different languages 
and allows good communication for the many different species that live 
and visit there. 

 

Time Travel 

Being the latest in technology, the great ship can move in time, 
something that is not possible in most of the smaller Beamships. As 
explained earlier, the older Beamship breaks into hyperspace to move 
through the vast distances of space. Hyperspace can be utilized in 
different ways. When the small Beamship breaks into hyperspace, this is a 
form of time travel where time and space become paralyzed. A better way 
of saying it might be that time and space push against each other, 
causing a complete standstill of time and space. Just at that point, 
timelessness and spacelessness are passed by at immeasurable speeds in 
a part of a second, without any shift of time in the real world. In effect, 


this is time travel in stagnant time, whereby the Beamship appears at its 
destination at the same time it leaves its starting point. For a brief part of 
a second, it actually exists at its destination and its starting point at the 
same instant. This process is nothing more than a technically generated 
dematerialization and rematerialization process, where no time passes 
because of shifting or distortion. You could say that this is time travel 
without any time actually passing. 

In a common time travel into the future, time and space are simply 
paralyzed and no time passes in the material realm, yet to move in the 
timeless and cause time to pass in the real world, other factors are 
necessary. When this is done, time is not paralyzed and there is a shift in 
the timeless. The ship and its passengers will move forward into the 
future, skipping through time that cannot be reclaimed. If it were possible 
to monitor this event on your watch, you would see that for every five 
seconds that pass in normal space, you would move one second forward 
into the timeless. 

This is made possible by regulating the time between dematerialization 
and rematerialization by the speed effect, for only in the timeless itself 
can the shift in time be controlled. The timeless can be broken down 
into a tremendous number of intervals which is beyond the complete 
understanding of the Pleiadians, but they know enough about it to 
manipulate it. For instance, a single second in the timeless is equal to 
millions of years in normal space. This means that if the ship would 
penetrate into the timeless and slow down or stop, they would move so 
far back in time that they would never again see their home worlds. 
Just the process of remaining for a few seconds with lowered speed in 
the timeless would cause many billions of years to pass on Earth. On 
the return to normal time, Earth would have evolved billions of years 


and would have disintegrated into dust, while the occupants of the ship 
would return to normal space and only be a few seconds older. This 
may all seem fantastic, but it is the way it works. 

Even the brightest Pleiadian scientists do not fully understand all of the 
complexities of time and space and are still puzzled by many 
inconceivable details. They have solved some of the problems and 
secrets of time and space, but continue to work towards a better 
understanding. The knowledge and necessary understanding of the 
technology for passing through the universe has been discovered, but 
they, too, are only at the first stages of development in these areas and 
have much to learn. Their current level of science, though, does allow 
for the possibility for travelers to step into the timeless and experience 
eternity. 

 

The future is not a fixed thing, but merely a projection of events 
based on the present. 

 

Touching Eternity 

During the jumps in hyperspace, a certain amount of time actually 
passes in this fine-matter dimension. This makes it possible for the 
Pleiadians to actually hold themselves for a period of time in 
hyperspace, and while they are out of their material bodies, they make a 
spiritual bonding with eternity and can return to normal space with full 
cognition of the event. At one time or another almost all of the 
members of the crew have experienced this, and they have their own 
truth about the existence of the Creation and the wonders of spirit that 
are contained within it. 


In order to touch eternity, several minutes in the timeless are 
necessary to make a spiritual connection that will provide a meaningful 
experience. This will require that time and space be paralyzed while 
they purposely hold back the rematerialization of the ship for seven 
minutes while moving in the timeless for only a millionth part of a second. 
Because of the difference in the speed of time between hyperspace and the 
three-dimensional world that we live in, the clock in our normal time will 
advance by 5 times, which is equal to 35 minutes. 

One other unusual occurrence that will take place for the crew on the ship 
is that instead of getting older by 35 minutes, they will actually experience 
a rejuvenation of 28 minutes. This is because as the ship is in the process 
of making the leap, it will be held in a state of dematerialization for a 
period of 7 minutes while not moving in time, so everyone aboard will all 
have aged 7 minutes. The ability to hold the ship in a dematerialized state 
for 7 minutes occurs because of very advanced technology which can 
control the speed effect and keep the ship from slipping in the timeless. 
Meanwhile in the normal world, the clock is moving 5 times faster, so time 
will have advanced by 35 minutes when the ship rematerializes. This 
means, of course, that on Earth 35 minutes will have gone by on their 
watches, while only 7 minutes will have gone by onboard the ship, so in 
effect, the aging process has been slowed down by 28 minutes, and the 
crew have become younger. 

Here on Earth we are still wondering about Creation and what spiritual 
effect it may have on us. If we were allowed to travel onboard the great 
craft of the Pleiadians while they were holding themselves outside of time 
to touch the eternal force of Creation, we would for the first time in our 
brief lives feel the real truth of Creation and be filled with the 
understanding of the great eternity that controls all things. Once out of our 


material bodies and into the timeless, our spirits can sense our connection 
with Creation. By being able to stay there for several minutes, we would 
slowly become aware of the love and knowledge that is the spiritual force 
that runs the universe in which we live. Here in Creation is the absolute 
force and truth of all life, the calm, peaceful, and deeply serene feeling of 
love and togetherness that we are all part of. Here we can sense our 
connection to the Creation and know we are spiritual beings that are a part 
of all that is happening. 

For just a few minutes we would only be our spiritual selves without a 
body, feeling the power and enlightenment of the greatest force of all. 
There could be no better way to understand who we are and the meaning o 
our lives than to be in touch with Creation directly as a spirit-form. 

 

A Visit from the Pleiades 

One night about midnight, after I had been at the Star Center for about six 
weeks, I was walking down the road toward the house and noticed one of 
the F.I.G.U. members standing out in front. He motioned to me to come 
over and watch the sky. It was a beautiful night high in the hills of 
Switzerland; the sky was clear with a million stars painted against a black 
canvas. He didn't speak English very well, but he motioned for me to stand 
and watch the sky where he was pointing. He pointed to his watch for 
me to wait just a few minutes, which I did. Soon he raised his hand 
and pointed toward the eastern sky. I shifted my view to where he 
was pointing and there it was, rising up from the horizon, a streak of 
white light moving at a very fast rate. It climbed up steadily and then 
leveled off and began to race across the night sky in front of us. 
Appearing as a steady stream of white light, the object was moving 


considerably faster than anything else I had seen in the sky. It was 
similar to a shooting star, but rising up instead of falling. Then it took 
a slight turn and kind of bent right up into the sky and began to blend 
in with the stars. I was just standing there in amazement when my 
sky-watching partner turned to me and said, "Quetzal." That was the 
name of one of the Pleiadian pilots who frequently visited Billy. He was 
apparently leaving the underground base that the Pleiadians still have 
in Switzerland, and who knows where he was going. I had just seen 
my first Identifiable Flying Object. Now it was true for me, too. 

How the Universe Was Created 

 

The summer was turning out to be an even greater experience for me 
than I had hoped for. I was able to spend a lot of time with Billy and 
came to better understand this man who had been in touch with human 
life from other worlds. We would stay up late at night together 
watching the stars or just talking around the kitchen table. I was a 
night owl, too, so it worked out well for both of us. He liked to talk and 
seemed tireless when it came to discussing man's role in the universe. 

Our conversations would usually end up in the kitchen, which was my 
favorite spot for listening. Billy was very comfortable there, as it was 
the center of activity for the whole farm and had a real homey and 
friendly feel to it. The kitchen was not very big, certainly not spacious 
enough for the 15 people living there. One end of the room had a 
doorway leading to the outside and a window over the sink with a view 
overlooking the valley beyond. The other end of the room had a couple 
of shelves containing a small radio with pieces of paper piled on top of 
it, expressly kept there so that people could take notes whenever they 


had time to sit down and talk to Billy. I usually had my own notebook 
with me, but in most cases I found myself going for the note paper on 
the shelf just like everyone else, because you never knew when Billy 
would be in the mood to talk. 

I had just finished painting the garage one afternoon and was in the 
kitchen cleaning up. Billy was sitting alone at the table, having a cup of 
his favorite coffee. It was times like this that I could get some 
questions answered, so I asked him about the shape of the universe 
and what it looked like. He seemed in a mood to talk, so I grabbed 
some paper off of the radio and started taking notes. 

 

Pleiadian Science 

To most of us the universe is some large, unknown area full of galaxies, 
star clusters, black holes, and light years of endless space. We have no 
concept of how big the universe might be, its shape, or how it started. 
Modern science talks of a "big bang" theory, which seems to make 
sense, only very little is understood about it; and most of us would 
agree that there is some kind of "God Force," or Creational Energy, that 
must be responsible for life as we know it. While science is busy trying 
to unlock the logic of the Material Universe, our spiritual leaders are 
trying to better understand the role of Creational Energy. Seldom do 
these two schools of thought agree or understand each other, but 
eventually they must come to a common understanding; for the 
material world and the spiritual world are both art of the universe that 
we live in, and one cannot exist without the other. 

In order to better understand how our universe came about, let' start 
with the basis of understanding of Pleiadian science. They have no only 


been able to travel outside of time to explore the very beginnings f our 
universe, but have traveled beyond its barriers and learned from other 
races far more advanced than themselves about the infinite evolution f 
the Creation. 

Our universe is inside of a much larger realm of Creational Energy that 
the Pleiadians call the Absolutum. There are 10 to the 49th power (this 
10 with 49 zeros) number of universes in this large and most 
incomprehensible realm of spiritual energy. They have only been able 
to experience traveling in one other universe so far, but they have 
some understanding that each universe seems to be slightly different in 
size and development, yet are similar in shape. It is believed that the 
Absolutum is within an even greater Creational Force, but nothing is 
known of that. 

The spiritual energy of the Absolutum is called a Creation. A Creation, 
remember, does not exist in material form. It is intelligence in a form 
commonly called spirit. It is a nonmaterial living form of life made up of 
the spiritual energy of all of the life forms that are within it. This large 
body of Creational Energy, called the Absolutum, is a living life form 
itself and must continually strive to evolve. Evolution is learning. The 
process of thinking creates energy that forms into logical sequences of 
thought and creates knowledge. As knowledge becomes more complex, 
it turns into wisdom learned through experience. It is the wisdom 
learned from experience that creates spiritual growth. In order for 
spiritual energy to evolve, it must create material life forms that 
develop energy through thought engaged in experience. This means 
that the Creational Spiritual Energy of the Absolutum knows that it 
must create material life forms in order to continue its growth through 
evolution. These material life forms are called universes. Here is how 


the process works. 

Every living form in the universe is a part 
of the Creation and contributes 
to its evolution. 

 

 absolutum.jpg


First the Creational Energy of the Absolutum has a thought to continue its 
growth by creating a new Material Universe. This thought is concentrated 
until it becomes a unique consciousness of its own. If we could see the 
energy of this small thought, we would discover that it is shaped like an 
egg. At this point the small thought is floating in the large pool of spiritual 
energy in the Absolutum between the already-existing universes that are 
there. This small thought has contained within it the idea that it would 
like to create a Material Universe. This little thought takes up no more 
room in the Absolutum than a flea. The Creational Spiritual Energy of the 


Absolutum is doing this so that it can continue to evolve, as all living 
things must do. It has taken a small part of itself and started a new 
Creational Spirit that will develop a Material Universe. For clarity, let's call 
the Creational Energy of the Absolutum the Original Creation, and the 
new thought that is the beginning of our new universe will be called the 
New Creation, or simply the Creation. 

 

The Spiral 

After years of thinking, our New Creation is still a small thought that is 
reasoning and figuring out what it must do to grow. Since thought is 
energy in motion, a close examination would reveal that it is moving in a 
spiral formation. The spiral is a multi-dimensional pathway that directs 
the flow of the energy of this small thought. This spiral pattern was 
naturally created by the Original Creation when the thought was formed, 
and it will control the flow of energy in the New Creation forever. A multi-
dimensional spiral pattern would be impossible to draw here in our 
three-dimensional world, but the drawing below can give you an idea of 
how it might look.

The Spiral 

The spiral pattern that energy follows in the Creation. It dictates the flow of 


energy that contains the spiritual knowledge of the Creational Universe. 


The Sohar 

The knowledge contained within our small thought is oscillating along 
the path of the spiral in a pulsating fashion. It is growing in intelligence 
very slowly; after billions of years, the small egg-shaped energy spiral 
as evolved its understanding of how to continue its growth and 
explodes into a bright light called the Sohar. Along with some help from 
the Original Creation that started it, the tiny New Creation has 
expanded to the size it needs to be in order to develop the Material 
Universe. It has literally pushed its way in among the many other 
universes in the Absolutum and taken over the area it will need to 
develop the new Material Universe. There are no stars or material 
matter at this point, only spiritual fine-matter that has the wisdom and 
knowledge it has learned through billions of years of reason and a little 
help from the Original Creation that started it. 

The bright Sohar now appears between the many universes in the 
Absolutum and has just contributed to the evolution of the Original 
Creation and to the New Creation by virtue of its experience. The Sohar 
has taken its position, and has added itself to the 1049 number of 
universes that currently exist there. 

Our New Creation will always be a combination of spiritual energy and 
material matter, but at this point only the spiritual matter exists, for it 
is still evolving to the point where it understands how to create matter. 
This is a slow process and takes trillions of years, because the New 
Creation is slowly gathering knowledge which must be learned step by 
step. Never can a life form jump ahead in development, but must 


always learn everything through the slow process of experience. This is 
a fact that rules all life forms. You might say it is one of the first Laws 
of Creation. 

 

 sohar.jpg


The Ur 

Once the New Creational Spirit has reached this level of development, it 
receives a helping hand from the Original Creation in the form of a 
special energy called the Ur. This is the first and primary spiritual force 
of the Original Creation, and it is responsible for creating timelessness. 
The Ur is a highly evolved spiritual force that is also capable of creating 
other spirit-forms. In this case it provides the New Creation with the 
ability to think in a more rational manner. It also provides feelings, 
understanding, sense and reason, and the idea of life. 


 

The Forming of the New Material Universe 

The New Creation now uses its new thinking and reasoning abilities to 
create space and time, two factors which begin to form the matrix of 
the coming Material Universe. First the New Creation begins to create 
belts of energy which separate space and time into seven different 
layers, or bands, of spiritual energy. In appearance this would look 
something like a tree trunk. The center of the New Creation contains 
the highest evolution of energy and is labeled the Absolutum. The 
second band is a slightly lower evolution of energy and is not as bright. 
The third and fourth bands are diminishing in force of energy and will 
serve different purposes in the continuing development of the new 
Material Universe. The fifth band is most important, for here is where 
the material part of the universe will form. 0nly in the fifth band will 
there be stars, planets, and material life forms. 


 Belts.jpg


All of the other bands are different forms of spiritual energy that play a 
part in the development of the material band and will always be of a 
spiritual nature, not containing material matter. It is the purpose of the 
New Creation to develop the material band as part of its continuing 
evolution. The spirit al energy of the New Creation can think and reason 
and it has feelings, but in order to evolve, it must develop life forms 
which are capable of higher levels of consciousness. This is the purpose 
of the Material Belt. 

Between the fifth and sixth bands there is a layer of Creational Energy 
called the Changing Belt, which is involved in converting energy from one 
form to another. This sixth band is sometimes used for space flight, as 
time is different here, and great distances of time and space can be passed 
through in a matter of seconds. The seventh belt, which forms the outside 
layer of the universe, serves the task of protection and keeps out the 


energies from other universes. Since a universe is a material thing 
comprised of elements based on the evolution of the Creation that formed 
them, material matter from other universes that exist at different levels of 
evolution may not be compatible with ours, so the Push Belt protects us, as 
well as providing a kind of skin which repulses the other universes. 

 

Creating Matter 

As the Creation continues to evolve, the spiritual energy becomes more 
complex and more intelligent. As it continues, the mass of that energy also 
increases. This is because thought is energy, and as thought becomes 
more complex, it increases in force, creating density. The building blocks of 
solid components—the neutron, proton, and the electron—are generated by 
this. This forms the atoms of the chemical compounds which then, in their 
aggregate forms, create the solid outer wrap, something our scientists 
understand. This means that original energy is absolute matter, and 
original matter is absolute energy. The entire universe consists of matter 
and energy. Coarse-matter = solid matter, fine-matter = energy. 

 

The Evolution of Matter 

The original Sohar of bright light that established the area where the 
Material Universe would develop contained only the idea to do so. But this 
idea of light contains intelligence. This idea was only energy in a thought-
form. As thoughts continue, they form into consciousness, and 
consciousness forms into will. Will is then concentrated until it becomes 
dense enough to be called fluffy matter. Fluffy matter is energy in motion 
which oscillates according to the pattern of the multi-dimensional spiral 
before it is gas. Here is where the blueprint for all elements starts. As fluffy 


matter continues to evolve, it forms the first gas, hydrogen. Now we have 
an element with a positive charge in the nucleus and a single electron 
around it. Matter is being formed, and matter is energy in motion that 
contains intelligence, intelligence that contains the ongoing wisdom of the 
New Creation that started it. 

It is possible to create machines which convert matter to energy and vice 
versa. Matter is a sizable idea. All energies can be turned into solid matter. 
It is only necessary to concentrate energy very strongly and concentrate it 
very highly. This is done naturally and very slowly over trillions of years by 
the New Creation, for from it came the idea that started the process. The 
force of the spirit condenses and concentrates the idea to fine-matter 
energy, and with more concentration it then becomes coarse-matter. 
This is the process which will slowly evolve the spiritual energy of the 
fifth band into a Material Universe full of stars and planets and life 
forms. 

The atom breaks down to seven levels of matter/energy that we 
have yet to discover. 

 

Time Begins 

As the energy of the material band begins to evolve and becomes 
denser, the element of time provides motion. Time is an energy that 
moves in waves of pulses causing the rotation, movement, and 
pulsation of coarse-matter in the material belt. This happens before the 
energy has become gas and is in a state of concentration referred to as 
fluffy matter. This only happens in the material band because time, as 
we know it, only exists here. 

As time speeds through the material band, it moves in a predetermined 


pattern set by the multi-dimensional spiral. This spiral provides a path 
which moves energy through multiple dimensions. The Pleiadians have 
discovered more than 22 different dimensions so far and feel that there 
are many more. Each dimension differs in the kind of elements of 
matter which can exist there. Some dimensions have material time as 
we know it, and others move at speeds far beyond ours, while others 
are infinitely slow. 

As time passes through the Material Belt, the fluffy matter will begin to 
rotate and pulsate according to the speed of the pulses of time. As 
evolution continues, the fluffy matter will slowly become the gas which 
will make p the stars that form the systems we live in. Eventually 
planets form to provide the way for higher life forms. 

While this process of evolution is continuing, it is time which makes it 
all work. By controlling the speed of all of the subatomic particles that 
make up matter, the three-dimensional world that we live in—the stars, 
planets, and space—holds together and forms the appearance of a solid 
material world that we perceive. Without time, matter would be forming 
randomly and would never evolve into solid formations such as the 
stars and planets. 

We perceive the world around us with our eyes, and that tells us t at 
things are solid and that they are moving at a particular speed, which 
we call time. We generally think of time as the transition of one 
moment to another, and we gauge it by a clock. As all matter moves 
from one moment to the next, it appears smooth to us because we only 
see it and experience it with our physical senses. Under a microscope 
we see that matter at its smallest level is really oscillating fields of 
energy. What we don't see with our eye is that all matter is constantly 
in motion, perpetual motion that will last as long as the universe is in 


existence. Perpetual motion, then, is the most natural thing in the 
universe; our senses of sight, touch, smell, hearing, and taste are just 
not capable of perceiving it. 

 

Moving in Time 

The pulse energy of time is moving through the three-dimensional 
world we live in, causing the smooth flow of particles which hold 
everything together. For instance, the moon is really a mass of particles 
that stay together because time is controlling it. But what if we 
disturbed the speed of the particles that comprise the moon—what 
would happen to it? Would it move out of time? 

First, remember that at the smallest level, the moon is just a mass of 
spinning particles. Each particle has three stages of oscillation. The first 
state is a positive charge, the second is a 0 state that has no charge, 
and the third state is the negative charge. Billions of times per second 
the particle is oscillating between these states. The particle is in 
material form during the positive state. As it moves into the 0 state, it 
is no longer material matter, but becomes antimatter, or nonmaterial. 
In the negative state it is once again matter. The speed at which it 
oscillates through the three states is controlled by time, which is 
moving in waves of pulsed energy. All of the particles of the moon, 
then, are oscillating at a constant speed, so they are positive, 
nonmaterial, and negative at the same time. If all of the particles are 
doing the same thing at the same time, they can be formed into 
something which appears as solid. If the particles were all random, they 
could not form a solid object. 

Understanding this, let's say we develop a machine that can create time 


energy of our own, and this machine has a speed button on it so that 
we can cause the wave of pulses of our time energy to move at any 
speed that we want. Now let's aim it at the moon and turn in on. At 
first the particles of the moon will move at the same speed as before, 
so we can still see the moon. Now let's turn the speed dial on our time 
machine and bombard all of the particles that make up the moon with 
our time energy, causing them to oscillate a little slower. As we 
continue to turn the speed dial and slow down the particles of the 
moon, it will start to fade away. It is starting to move out of time. It is 
no longer moving at the same rate as the particles in the rest of the 
three-dimensional world and is falling behind. 

As we continue to turn the speed dial and slow down the particles, the 
moon will become invisible. We won't be able to see it with our eyes, 
because they only perceive things in our normal time. The moon has 
fallen out of time and is, in effect, time-traveling back into the past. 
By the way, it won't come back unless we find some way to speed the 
moon's particles up so that they can catch up with us. Once something 
is thrown out of time through this method, it doesn't come back. 

Remember that time started trillions of years ago when the fluffy 
matter began to have motion. Since then the matter of the universe 
began to move and rotate. You might say the clock of Creation 
started, and all particles of the universe have been moving in time 
since then. The idea is that time has been going for trillions of years. 
All of the particles of the material world we live in are moving down a 
multi-dimensional path set by the spiral formed by the Original 
Creation, which started a long time ago. If we look closely at a small 
section of the spiral, we see our three-dimensional world moving along 
at the speed set by the energy of time. Each period of time is still 


there in particle form. The material world creates a highway of charged 
particles that can be traced all along the path of the spiral. Spiritual 
energy is not attached to the path, but flows along with it. Since we 
are spiritual beings, only our bodies are material; our spirits are not 
attached to the path, but can move up and down the path and move in 
time. 

Imagine if you will a strip of film. Hold it up to the light and look 
through it. If you hold it still, you can see each individual picture. If 
you move it up or down past your eyes, the pictures begin to run 
together and your eyes perceive them as smooth, flowing motion. 
When you watch a movie, the film is moving past your eyes at 24 
frames each second. The film strip is similar to the material world that 
is on the path of the spiral. Your spiritual self is like your eyes moving 
over it. A movie film is moving at 24 frames per second, and time is 
broken down into billions of frames per second. All of the particles that 
make up our known three-dimensional world are oscillating at billions 
of times per second, creating the illusion of smooth, flowing solid 
objects. 

The human spirit form is not part of the coarse-matter controlled 
by time, but is part of the fine-matter world that moves along 
with it. 

If we wanted to see the moon in the year 1,000, it is there on the path 
of the spiral; all we have to do is find a way to go and see it. The 
human spirit-form is capable of moving itself in time through methods 
of meditation. In this process, the spirit can separate itself from the 
material consciousness of the human body and move in time down the 
path of the spiral, viewing or visiting other time frames. Everything that 
has gone before us in history is fixed on the path of the spiral and 

 


cannot be changed. The future is only a projection of things to come, 
based on the present. It can be changed or altered since it is not a 
fixed thing. It has not happened yet. This realization tells us that 
everything in the past is there and can be visited by some means, but 
the events of the future are being made up. In effect, then, all of our 
history is existing at the same time, like a giant file cabinet of 
information that can be accessed at any time. All we need is the means 
to open it up and select what we want to see. 

We can also build machines that can travel in time, such as the 
Pleiadian Beamships that move in time by accessing hyperspace. Then, 
through the application of controlling the particles of the ship, they can 
move in time and reenter the three-dimensional world at a different 
place on the path of the spiral. This high technology is only possible 
when a race has the understanding of the spiritual and material realms, 
since both are needed to fully understand the workings of the universe 
that make this possible. 

The Planets Form 

At this point in the development of our universe, trillions of years have 
gone by. The New Creation has reasoned and figured out every step of 
the way with the help of the Ur energy of the Original Creation. The 
accumulated wisdom of all that the New Creation has learned is 
imbedded within it, for it has learned it all from actual experience. 
Since our New Creation is within the Original Creation and is connected 
to it, it has a reference source by which it can learn and try out new 
ideas. It is no accident that the New Creation is evolving the way it is, 
for it must follow the pattern created by the Original Creation. Because 
of this, all Creations are created the same way and must evolve 
through the same steps of experience. 


 spiral.jpg


The Original Creation is a blueprint, or guide, of how to do it, and the 
New Creation takes the blueprint and uses it to create its own Material 
Universe. Through the process of thinking and reasoning, energy is 
created; and when the process of thinking and reasoning is correct 
according to the Original Creation, then that wisdom is added to the 
accumulated wisdom of the New Creational Universe. This spiritual 
growth is what evolution is. As the New Creation evolves, so does the 
Original Creation, so all universes contribute to the growth and 
evolution of the Absolutum. 

As fluffy matter evolves into gas and spirit becomes more intelligent 
through experience, the galaxies then form. Their movement, rotation, 
and pulsation are controlled by the pulses of time. Trillions of years 
elapse during this process as the Material Universe is forming. Then 
come the clusters of gas that create the suns and stars, and eventually 


the planets form around the stars, signaling that the New Creation now 
understands how to create he mineral kingdom. All along, the spiritual 
energy of the New Creation is learning and growing through the 
experience. 

Once planets are formed, reasoning and thinking continue until the food 
kingdom comes into existence. Throughout the process, the New 
Creation is following the blueprint of the Original Creation and using 
thinking and reasoning to understand the results of its experiences. The 
development of flora and fauna is just one more step in creating a more 
complex and higher-developed universe. 

As the food kingdom is developed, the way is cleared for the creation of 
animals to eat the food. Fauna, the animal kingdom, is responsible for 
the evolution of the coarse matter of our bodies. Once the animal 
kingdom as evolved the coarse body material to a level of evolution 
that is high enough, it is possible for the spirits of human life to come 
into material body. Man then begins the material life cycles and evolves 
the New Creation to perfection through the spiritual energies created by 
each spirit-form's growth. 

Life develops in many different forms, depending on the planet and the 
sun system it is in. If a world has the necessary elements of water, 
acids, radiation from the sun, and spiritual evolution, then life forms of 
varying sizes and shapes will naturally develop. The human form is the 
most dominant and is found in all parts of the universe where the 
conditions are correct. The human form also represents a higher level 
of spiritual development by the New Creation, for it obviously takes 
more understanding and knowledge to create a human body than it 
does to create gas, minerals, water, or plants. We are seeing the slow 
evolution of the New Creation through the learning experience. 


The human life form is capable of providing the New Creation with the 
highest order of learning experience and thinking that will be added to 
its evolution. The human form represents the first time the New 
Creation as been able to create a life form capable of rational thought 
and reasoning. Each level of development—fluffy matter, gas, minerals, 
flora, and fauna—has taken a more complex level of understanding and 
consciousness to create. The human form represents the highest level 
of understanding and consciousness. Humans can think and experience 
on their own and provide energy to the New Creation, which in turn 
provides energy to the Original Creation, the spiritual part of the 
Absolutum. There is a chain of wisdom from the lowest levels to the 
highest which all contribute to the evolution of all life forms throughout 
the chain of Creations. 

As the universe continues to grow, there is a point where the 
experiences of the material world can no longer provide new wisdom to 
the New Creation. There are limits to how high the consciousness of 
material life forms can expand. In the human form, for instance, there 
is a point wherein information gathered by our material senses is not of 
high enough consciousness to continue the evolution of Creation. The 
human form then transforms into a higher form of consciousness, which 
no longer requires the death cycle or the material body. 

Our New Creation, which started as nothing more than an idea, has 
expanded in size and created a material realm from which to gain 
experience. It has had a mature adult life through the experience of 
learning from a Material Universe, and now it must rest, for the length 
of time that a Creation can sustain itself is related to the strength of its 
spiritual knowledge. Just as it must learn everything in small steps, it 
can also only learn so much at a time. Learning turns into wisdom 


through experience. 


The New Creation Sleeps 

At a certain point in the development of the New Creation, it will cease 
to expand and begin to contract back into itself. Based on the spiritual 
evolution of the Creation, it can only sustain its existence so long, and 
then it begins to contract back into itself to prepare for sleep. The 
Material Belt and all life forms in it return to a spiritual existence. 

One of the problems for our scientists in determining the age of our 
universe is the speed of light itself. Light is faster in the past than in the 
future. Astronomers look out into the universe and study light that is 
billions of years old. New formulas will have to be created that allow for the 
fact that the older the light, the faster it is moving. The speed of light is 
also variable, depending on gravity and the mass of space it is passing 
through. As our universe continues to expand, all energies will continue to 
slow down. Until we have a better understanding of the entire cycle of the 
universe, it will be difficult to gauge the time until the expansion is over 
and the contraction begins. 

This is a time for the New Creation to contemplate the experiences from 
which it has gained wisdom. At this point the sleeping Creation is complete 
y spiritual consciousness; there is no material matter. As it rests, it will 
finish out its thinking and reasoning on the wisdom learned from the 
experiences the material life forms have provided. Since only the material 
world can provide the experiences, there will not be any new data, just 
contemplation of what has happened. Creation has reasoned and learned 
how to create seven cycles of consciousness, beginning with intelligent 
light, which turns into fluffy matter, then gas, minerals, flora, fauna, and 


finally the human form. All of these life forms have a level of consciousness 
that contributed some measure of wisdom to the evolutionary process of 
the New Creation. 

The complete cycle of our New Creation will be 311,040,000,000,000 
years, also known by the Pleiadians as a greattime, beginning with the 
First Idea of Creation and ending as it moves into its sleep period. The 
first 47,000,000,000,000 years were spent in a purely spiritual form, 
before the Material Belt begins to evolve and the gas started to become 
stars. The planet Earth is 626 billion years old and the sun is 1 trillion, 730 
billion years old, if you date them back to the gas balls that they evolved 
from. Since we are currently in the 47th trillion year of a New Creation that 
is expected to last over 311 trillion years, it's plain to see that it will be a 
very long time before the sleep period will begin. 

The knowledge the Pleiadians have of the New Creation is due in part to 
their technology, which allows them to move back in time and study the 
step-by-step growth for themselves. Combined with the spiritual 
development they have personally achieved, they have also been able to 
access realms of higher consciousness and learn from them. 

During the sleep time the New Creation rests, contemplates, and prepares 
itself for a new life. Once this period is over, it will awaken and start the 
process all over again. Just as before, it will start with intelligent light; 
evolve it into fluffy matter, then gas, mineral, flora, fauna, and then the 
human form. This time it will start with the accumulated wisdom learned 
from the first cycle and continue to evolve. 

Creation will go through seven complete greattimes of waking and 
sleeping. Each one will be similar, varying in wisdom and evolution. All 
greattime cycles, though, will create Material Belts in order to learn 


from the experiences gained by the evolving life forms. Once it has 
completed seven greattimes the process stops and the New Creation 
will transform into a higher form called an Ur Universe. The completion 
of seven greattimes is called an Eternity. 

 

1 Greattime= 311,040,000,000,000 years 

7 Greattimes = 2,177,280,000,000,000 is an Eternity 

Cosmic Greattime = 15,240,960,000,000,000 years 

There are three types of universes that the Pleiadians are familiar with 
so far. Even though it is estimated that there are over 1049 number of 
different universes in the Absolutum, they have only identified the 
purpose of three types. First is the Ur, which is the first and primary 
source of evolution of the Absolutum. An Ur Universe also goes through 
seven steps of evolution, but it differs in that is does not create 
Material Belts in order to evolve; instead it creates other universes 
called Creational Universes. The universe that we live in is called a 
Creational Universe because it creates material life forms in order to 
evolve. It is the first stage of development in the evolution of 
universes. 

Once an Ur Universe goes through its seven stages of development, 
creating other universes, it transforms into what is called a Central 
Universe. The function of a Central Universe is not understood very well 
because he Pleadians have not been able to enter one, and they rely 
mostly on the experience of higher life forms for information that it 
exists. 

The understanding of Creation provides us with an answer to the 
meaning of our lives. Our brief, transitory material lives fulfill the most 


important task of learning; for it is through learning that we think and 
create energy with our brains. That energy moves like waves across 
the universe and has an effect on other life forms, including the planet 
we live on, the plant kingdom, and all other living creatures. The 
combined thinking power of more than six billion people on Earth 
creates energy which affects all levels of nature, as well as each other. 
If ever you doubted the importance of your life, you should know that 
you are a wonderful and essential part of the Creation you live in, and 
you share in the responsibility of its evolution. Once you have this 
understanding and experience your connection to Creation, you will feel 
the spiritual bonding of all living things. 

The purpose of the material life is to provide wisdom learned from 
experience to your spirit. But it is most important to realize that you are a 
spiritual being going through a series of material lives to feed your 
spirit. The food your spirit evolves on is called truth. As you cross the 
consciousness barrier from material to spirit, you will come in touch 
will your connection to Creation, and the truth will become part of 
you. Since you are a spirit-form created from the Eternal Spiritual 
Energy of the New Creation, you can access the knowledge of 
Creation through your spiritual consciousness anytime you choose to 
recognize it. We are all part of the guiding light of the Eternal 
Creation. 

 

The Evolution of Human Life 

The Logic of Creation 

Now that we have a better understanding of what Creation is and how 
we fit into it, the importance of our lives should be clearer. We can see 


from the steps that the New Creation goes through that there is definite 
logic to its evolution. Life is not a random series of actions but an 
orderly, rational, and logical sequence of events that gives meaning to 
our lives and follows the blueprint designed by the Original Creation 
and emulated by our New Creation. If we look closely at the evolution 
of the New Creation and the steps that it follows, we can find definite 
guidelines that parallel our human life. 

The New Creation Starts with an Idea 
Man is conceived through the idea of his parents. 

Creates Material Life in Order to Evolve We are spiritual beings who 
come into life through the womb and live a material life. 

Earns Evolution through Small Steps of Learning All wisdom in life is won 
through experience. Man cannot jump ahead to learn the great 
mysteries of life; he must learn everything in small steps. 

Creation Goes through Seven Stages of Evolution Just as the Creation 
goes through seven greattimes in order to reach perfection and evolve, 
man also lives through seven stages of development, which follow the 
logic of Creation. 

Creation Has an Awake Period and a Sleep Period Man is awake during 
the day, and he sleeps at night. At the end of his material life he will 
sleep on the other side, and then he will wake up to reenter the 
material world. 

Creation Evolves into a Higher Life Form Called an Ur Man begins as a 
material life form, and he eventually evolves into a being of lighter 
density where the death cycle is no longer necessary. After years of 
slow evolution, he becomes part of a collective consciousness that does 
not have a material body, but exists in pure spiritual form. Collective 


consciousnesses have seven spirits. 

The Seven Evolutionary Steps of Man On Earth we are just becoming 
aware of our spiritual consciousness and its ability to communicate with 
the eternal knowledge of Creation. The great spiritual minds of the 
Pleiades have analyzed the development of the human being and 
discovered how the evolution of the Creation dictates the development 
of the human spirit-form as well. Just as the Creation must earn its way 
through seven greattimes on a path to perfection, so must man. The 
human life form evolves through understanding learned from 
experience, following the same design as Creation. There are seven 
main levels of evolutionary development with seven sublevels. 

Creation goes through the development of seven levels of life forms 
intelligent light, fluffy matter, gas, mineral, flora, fauna, and human— 
to complete the cycle of one greattime. It will then repeat that seven 
times in order to reach perfection and transform itself into a life form of 
higher consciousness. As part of Creation, man follows this same 
guideline and goes through seven main levels of development, each with 
seven sublevels of learning. Man's existence begins as a spirit-form, 
which is connected to the eternal energy of the Creation, and ends up a 
pure spiritual form that returns to the Creational Source, becoming part 
of the knowledge that directs the growth of the universe. 

On the planet Earth the natural cycles of development occur as they do 
throughout the universe. First the planet is formed from the primordial 
gas, which takes billions of years. As evolution continues, eventually 
the mineral kingdom is formed, followed by the flora, or food, kingdom. 
The animal kingdom is next, since now there is food available. All along 
this path of development, the spiritual energy of the New Creation is 
gaining in wisdom that gives it the intelligence to create the next step. 


As the energy becomes more intelligent, its force, or vibrational level as 
some call it, increases. It can be seen and measured as an aura around 
all things. 

The animal kingdom plays a very important part for humanity, for it is 
responsible for increasing the level of spiritual energy on the planet so 
that human life is possible. Once the animal spirit has developed to its 
highest potential, the stage is set for the first signs of human life to 
come into existence. We do not evolve from the animal kingdom, but 
we owe them a debt of thanks for evolving the coarse-matter from 
which we create our bodies. The human spirit-form is a unique spirit-
form that is created with the ability for rational thinking and 
understanding; this is what separates us from the animals. 

Once the level of evolution is high enough on the planet and the animal 
kingdom has evolved the coarse-matter sufficiently, the first human 
spirit-form can come into life. On Earth this happens much the same as 
it has on other planets: a single-celled creature is made from a 
combination of plant material and animal feces. This first Earth human 
life form, a single-cell creature, was really nothing more than slime. 
Evolution came into play, and as the new human form continued to 
grow through numerous material lives, it was eventually able to 
procreate as we do now. 

The Pleiadians have studied the process of evolution of the human spirit 
for thousands of years. They learned that as man goes through his 
many material lives, he will develop through seven main steps of 
evolution that closely follow the same pattern set up by the Original 
Creation and emulated by the New Creation. Since the New Creation 
itself revolves around cycles of seven, they have learned to relate the 
growth of man to these same steps. If we could attend a Pleiadian 


school, we would learn these seven steps of evolutionary development 
of human life, along with explanations of the seven sublevels.

STEP ONE—BEGINNING LIFE 

1.Beginning Development of the Intellect 

These are the first material lives on Earth. The human form is nothing 
more than a spirit-form trying to develop its intellect. Them is no 
accumulated knowledge from previous lives, only the intellect of the 
spirit which has not lived in a body before and can barely take care of 
itself, for it has no understanding of the material world at this time. All 
humans look the same at this point since our facial expressions, bodies, 
color, etc., are expressions of experiences, wisdom, emotions, and ego 
that we have not yet developed. Our lives are short, as our spirits have 
very low energy to sustain the material existence. We also die young 
due to poor health. 

Beginning Development of Spiritual Growth 

Through numerous lifetimes we begin to think and provide wisdom to 


the spirit. The process of evolution has begun. Simple-minded, e can 
barely feed ourselves and sustain life. 

Beginning Development of Reason 

We can now think and reason a little better. We have lived many brief 
lives and are starting to build intelligence from the experiences of 
previous lives. We are 20 to 30 million years old at this point. The 
counting of age begins with the start of the first material lifetime and 
includes the sleep period on the other side that we call death. 

Beginning Use of Thinking 

We can live longer now, for we are able to feed ourselves, start a fire, 
and build shelter. Our accumulated wisdom is providing us with some 
assistance since our spirit is now beginning to understand the physical 
existence better, and it can provide the occasional hunch or idea 
learned from previous lives to help out. 

Beginning Development of Reasonable Actions 

We are still very primitive and living in caves. We don't get along with 
each other, and in our material consciousness we have absolutely no 
idea who we are or why we are here. We are trying to develop some 
more rational thinking patterns, but it's going slow. We can't even 
understand each other. 

Beginning Development of Thinking and Action 

Rational thinking and understanding are becoming useful in our day-to-
day lives. We are starting to understand each other and are starting to 
work together. Man's appearance is unique, for his body and face are 
reflecting the experiences and wisdom of his life. 

Beginning Awareness of Reason 


Reasoning and rational thinking are now in control of our lives. We can 
communicate through language, symbols, and signs. We are starting to 
form communities and learning to get along. 

 

STEP TWO-LIFE WITH REASONING AND RATIONAL THINKING 

Beginning Development of Reason 

Our ability to reason and solve problems is making a difference. We 
are still not aware that we are also a spirit-form. We are only 
beginning to question and look for answers. Life is purely a material 
existence to us. 

Awareness of Reasoning and Its Use 

We are now aware of reasoning and understand its use. We are 
searching for answers to our existence. Emotions are coming into play 
as fear, anger, and hostility begin to govern our lives. We all look 
much different from each other now, for we are noticeably on different 
paths of discovery and experience. The problems in life are being 
solved through our reasoning ability, and we now regard ourselves as 
rational, thinking beings. 

Development of Awareness of Higher Influences 

We are aware that there are powers in the world more advanced than 
our own and are searching for them. We question the power of the 
stars, sun, moon, and nature around us. We are unsure of our 
existence and are looking for meaning to our lives. The moon and the 
stars puzzle us as we search for answers to their existence. 

Awareness of Higher Influences 

We start to develop belief systems, such as worshipping idols, gods, 


and the sun, without actually having any knowledge of what we are 
doing. We are still without knowledge of the spiritual side of life. 

Belief in Higher Forces. Superstition, Fear of Evil, Veneration of Good 

Here we see the development of religions, superstition, and gods. Our 
lack of real knowledge of Creation and fear make us vulnerable to 
powers that we don't understand. Most of the current mass of 
humanity on Earth is at this stage. 

First Awareness of the Meaning of our Lives and the real Spiritual Life 

Cognitions and Their Use. Spiritual Healing, Telepathy 

Now comes man's first awareness of the spiritual world. He is looking 
for answers but has no real understanding. It is the beginning of 
awareness of spirit and its uses. This will be the first attempt at using 
the powers of spirit without real knowledge. This is the current 
position of the average Earthman, who at this level of development 
can gain only 9.4 months of spiritual growth within lifetime. At this 
point we are around 80 to 100 million years old as spiritual beings. 

Development of Knowledge and Wisdom 

The mind is developing, and our accumulated wisdom learned from 
millions of years of lifetimes is creating intellect. Man is becoming 
aware that there is more to life than his brief material existence. 

 

STEP THREE—LIFE WITH INTELLIGENCE 

Development of the Intellect. High Technology, Advancements in Spiritual 
Forces. First Development of Living Forms 

It is the age of the mind. We can be considered intelligent life forms 


now. We have broken through the age of ignorance and ha e advanced 
well in the sciences. Our awareness of our spirits and our connection 
to Creation is stronger, for we are learning more about the powers of 
our spirit. We have learned to create new foods, to crossbreed 
animals, and are searching for the understanding of how life works. 

Awareness and Exercise of Knowledge, Truth, and Wisdom. Slow 
Dissolution of Acceptance of Belief 

We are leaving behind the thinking of the past. We no longer accept 
old myths, idols, and false gods. Real intellect and reasoning are 
providing us with enlightenment. 

First Usage of Knowledge and Wisdom 

High technology is becoming part of our world. Genetic engineering 
has led to the creation of the first life forms. The secrets of the 
universe are beginning to unfold to us, and man is learning about his 
place in the scheme of things. This is the present position of educated 
Earth human being, scientist, etc. 

 Awareness and Utilization of Nature's Laws. Development of High 
Technology that Leads to the Creation of Living Forms 

Man is leaving behind his old belief structures and is gaining in wisdom 
about the universe around him. Here we see development in the sciences 
as man learns to really understand the forces of natt.re. There is high 
technology in the field of genetics as we learn to clone our cells and 
experiment with different life forms. 

The Use of Spiritual Forces in Life 

The development of spirit is now playing a bigger part in the role of man. 
We have learned more about the ability of spirit to help us in life and are 


beginning to solve fewer of our problems by material means. 

Understanding Life through Wisdom, Truth, and Logic 

Man is on the verge of real understanding of Creation and the Material 
Universe around him. Contact with higher life forms begins. The spiritual 
world is now more understood, and the true meaning of life is unfolding. 
Our existence as part of Creation is becoming clearer, and peace among 
men is starting as the need for material things slips away. 

Awareness of the Real Meaning of Life 

Just a few border and spiritual scientists would be at this level. Man has 
real knowledge now of the Laws of Creation and how to use them in 
society. Belief systems and religions are fading away as and develops true 
understanding of his role in Creation. It is understood that gods are 
actually human life forms with greater knowledge than most, and we now 
know that gods are also subject to Creation. At this level of development 
the human can advance spiritually as much as 89.7 years within a 
lifetime. 

 

STEP FOUR—LIFE WITH SPIRITUAL UNDERSTANDING 

Clear Understanding of Spirit 

We can now live more in harmony with nature and Creation because we 
have real knowledge about life and spirit. Our thinking is clear, but we 
have little experience dealing with life using spiritual power 

The Truth of Spiritual Knowledge and Wisdom 

We begin to experiment with spiritual knowledge and learn about s uses 
in telepathy, telekinesis, time travel, and control over nature. 


Use of the Spiritual Knowledge and Wisdom 

We now have real knowledge of the spiritual forces as we begin o use 
telepathy and the other spiritual powers in our day-to-day life. Many of 
our problems are solved with spiritual consciousness rather than material 
senses. Our spiritual self is now understood, and we work with the 
energies of all life forms. 

Cognition of Creation and Its Laws 

Through the development of spirit we come to have personal knowledge 
of our connection to Creation and have a better understanding of the 
meaning of life and our role within it. The material world is becoming less 
important to us as we are learning more with our spiritual senses. 

Living from the Creational Laws. The End of the Conceit of Belief 

There is a major breakthrough in our development, for now we are living 
from the Creational Laws and have moved into a time of higher 
consciousness. We are perceiving life with the higher abilities of spirit 
instead of the simple material senses of sight, touch, sme1, hearing, and 
taste. Our accumulated wisdom from previous lives is being very helpful. 
Our previous lives and the experiences learned from them are clear to us. 

Controlled Utilization of Spiritual Forces 

The power of our spirit is causing us to live longer. Health problems are 
vanishing because we control our bodies through spiritual balance. We are 
beginning to develop a society of integrity wherein we can sense each 
other's emotions and thinking. The Pleiadians are living at this level. 

First Ability to Create Living Creatures 

We have developed very high technology and can roam the universe. The 
knowledge of the material life is ours, and we create our own life forms to 


work for us. Our genetic scientists can preserve extinct species by 
recreating them in the laboratory. 

 

STEP FIVE—LIFE WITH CREATIONAL COGNITION 

Creating Other Life Forms 

We can greatly extend the life span to thousands of years through a 
combination of technology and spiritual power. Our lives are becoming 
more spiritual than material, for the force of our spirit and our high 
evolution allow us access to higher forms of consciousness in Creation. The 
material senses are not playing a big part in gathering the information to 
form our life experiences, for more of this is being done by spirit. We are 
giving advice to other civilizations and helping them with their first steps. 

Construction of Synthetic Livable Creatures 

Our technical knowledge of the material form allows us to create high 
forms of life that can be mistaken for human. We are becoming more 
spiritual beings and spend more time in connection with Creation. Our 
awareness of the material world is becoming less important to us. Our 
concerns are for the creation of life and its development. 

 Spiritual Development for Control of Organic Forms of Life 

We are beginning to develop the force of our spirit to the point where we 
can control the birth of other creatures. We are developing the ability to 
control the forces of nature—levitation of matter the control of gravity, and 
electricity. We are starting to look and think more alike, for we have all 
learned many of the same things. 

Interest in Mastering Life and All Its Forms 

We are becoming less concerned with our material senses as we search for 


the remaining knowledge of life and spirit. We are becoming masters of all 
knowledge of the human form. 

Recognition and Awareness of Earlier Lives 

We can control time and space with our spirit and can move through our 
previous lifetimes. We are becoming masters of the knowledge of human 
life and its development. 

 King of Wisdoms ISHWISH (IHWH). The Level of a God 

We are now masters of the human knowledge. We are still n material form, 
but have little need for our material senses. We communicate and 
experience the world mostly with our spirit. This is the level of a god, a 
material being that has mastered the knowledge of man, a King of 
Wisdom. In ancient times gods ruled the Earth and controlled the minds of 
men. It was believed that they had power over life and death, which is not 
true, for only Creation has that power. There are no longer any gods ruling 
over Earth, but many people have not relinquished this ancient concept 
and taken control of their own lives. 

The Transition to Spirit Begins 

This is the transition time for the material being. Having evolved through 
all of the stages of development of man, we are ready to transform into 
higher consciousness and leave the material plain. We now look very much 
the same, for we have all assimilated the same knowledge and have 
arrived at the same level of understanding. We are mostly spiritual, and it 
shows in our bodies and faces. We are at peace with Creation and live with 
the complete understanding of love and life. 

 

STEP SIX—LIFE IN SPIRITUAL FORM 


 Cognition of Spiritual Peace, Universal Love, and Creation The last stage of 
material life. The experiences that are needed Ito continue our evolution 
can no longer be provided by the material senses. We are becoming a pure 
spiritual form. We are living in harmony with Creation and feel the constant 
love of eternity. 

Beginning of Life as a Spiritual Form 

The material body is becoming dysfunctional and serves little purpose 
anymore. We are interacting almost totally with our spirit. We no longer 
require sleep or food since we are becoming a pure spiritual form. Our 
bodies are becoming lighter in weight as the material is fading away. 

Development of Other Life Forms 

The material body is becoming less dense. It is possible to see right 
through us because our bodies are becoming more like light. The death 
cycle has stopped, and we live continuously in this form. Our existence is 
almost purely spiritual now, and our time is spent in helping with the 
development of those younger than ourselves. We are taking part in the 
education and spiritual guidance of those in the material world. We are 
several billions of years old now. 

The End of the Material Life 

The transition into light body is complete, and we are living our first 
spiritual existence. Our material body is completely gone and we now 
exist in a purely spiritual form. We use the accumulated wisdom we have 
learned to help those younger than ourselves. Our spirit now exists with 
the constant consciousness of love and understanding for all things. We 
still have awareness of self and our personality. We are around 70 billion 
years old as a spirit-form. Billions of more years will be spent as a 
spiritual being striving for perfection before we transform over into 


Creation. 

Collective Consciousness 

Millions of years pass as our spiritual self comes together with six other 
spirits, and we become a collective consciousness comprise, of seven 
spirit-forms. We still have awareness of self and are actively taking part in 
the development of human life. This is the same level as Arahat 
Athersata, the timeless teacher of great masters such as Immanuel. 

Final Spiritual Existence 

This is the last existence of the spiritual self. We are in the last years as a 
collective consciousness of seven. Our personal identity fades away as we 
reach the highest level of consciousness called the Petale Level. Here all 
collective consciousnesses come together as one to prepare for the 
transition to pass over into Creation. 

Pass Over into the Creation 

Our evolution as an independent human life form is complete. As part of 
the highest level of consciousness, the Petale Level, we will pass over and 
become part of the Creation itself. Here we join up with all of those who 
have gone before us and become part of the great eternal knowledge of 
Creation which provides guidance and love to all things. We have earned 
this right through billions of years of experience, which has provided us 
with the complete, accumulated knowledge of all things. We have 
experienced and completely understood the evolution of a universe. 

 

STEP SEVEN—LIFE WITH CREATION 

Twilight Sleep through Eternity 

Our spirit-forms are part of Creation that will sleep for a period of seven 


greattimes, or an eternity. During this time all life and the whole universe 
ceases to exist. There is no space or time, only the nothingness of sleep. 
It is not a time for creative thought, but a restful time of cogitation. 

A New Greattime for Creation 

Creation awakens and starts to create a new universe, just as before. We 
are now part of a completely new cycle. Our awareness of self is gone, for 
we are one with eternity now and are contributing to the spiritual 
knowledge that guides all. 

Creation Starts a New Universe 

Creation will once again begin its evolutionary cycle by creating living life 
forms which can contribute to its evolution through wisdom gained from 
experience. A New Universe will be formed to repeat the cycle of 
evolution. The energy of the Creation has evolved to a higher level. 

Creation of New Spirit forms 

Creation is constantly improving and creating new spirit-form. Spirit-forms 
are small parts of creation that will evolve by becoming material life forms. 
Creation will continue to evolve and improve itself through the cycle of life 
forms. Creation is constantly starting new spirit-forms throughout the 
complete cycle of the Material Universe. Even here on Earth new spirit-
forms are coming into life. Since they have no accumulated knowledge or 
intelligence, we will often think of them as idiots or insane. In many cases 
they are just new spirits who have come into a material world far too 
advanced for them. 

Moving into Spiritual Form 

It is part of the function of Creation to continually strive for spiritual 
greatness by gaining in knowledge. Since the spirit is always awake and 


never sleeps during a greattime, it is observing and learning at all 
times. The human form continues to think and provides food or the 
spirit. Creation is continuing to strive for perfection in itself in order to 
become an Ur Universe. 

The Completion of Seven Cycles 

Creation cannot degenerate. It is always moving forward in its 
evolution. The same applies to the human spirit-form, for it cannot 
degenerate either. It is possible to be stagnant or to waste lifetimes 
without learning anything, but never does the spirit become ill or 
degenerate. Seven cycles of evolution through the creation of Material 
Universes will be completed as the energy level of Creation continues to 
increase. 

The Final Improvement in the Seventh Period 

As any Creation reaches the last cycle of its seven periods and as 
mastered the highest improvement possible, it will transform into an Ur 
Universe that is capable of creating other Creational Universes such as 
ours. The energy level of the Ur Universe is so great that it can provide 
cosmic life force energy to several Creational Universes at one time. Its 
existence is pure spiritual energy. The cycle of evolution of spiritual 
energy continues. 

 

The Laws of Creation 

Since the logic of Creation is absolute and does not change, we can say 
it becomes a law. Creation always follows the path of the Absolutum. It 
always has an awake period and a sleep period, and it evolves from a 
simple idea to a higher form of consciousness through the experiences 
learned through the seven stages of development. Creation dictates the 


laws of physics, math, and the other sciences; we merely discover the 
knowledge that is already there. 

If we can learn to understand Creation and the process of evolution it is 
going through, then we will have discovered for ourselves how to create 
laws for our society by which we can live. Everywhere in nature the 
Laws of Creation are obvious, if only we would open our eyes to see. 

In man's early development he may praise the sun or worship the noon 
in hopes that his simple life will be better. That is the level of his 
understanding at the time, and he will make simple laws for his society. 
As we progress and grow in experience, which leads to intelligence and 
higher consciousness, we will make different laws that reflect our 
understanding of Creation that are more in line with the complexity and 
level of knowledge of our society. We are continually evolving and 
changing as a society; therefore, we must be open to creating new laws 
and paradigms that will keep pushing us forward instead of holding us 
back. 

We must become aware that all living things are part of the same 
Creation. There is an interconnection that binds us all together, 
something like a network of consciousness that I refer to as spiritual 
bonding. As we think, our thoughts run across the network and affect all 
other life forms at are connected to it. Thought is energy, and energy 
contains thought. They are the same thing existing in different form. 

Spiritual growth is the forming of logical thinking that is harmonious with 
the Laws of Creation. When you have perceived something correctly, with 
great clarity of thought, and understood it to the point that it has become 
part of your life, dictating your actions, the wisdom learned from the 
experience contributes to your spiritual growth. In order to control your 


spiritual growth, you must learn to take 100% responsibility for your own 
actions, thoughts, and deeds. You cannot dump your responsibilities on 
any other life forms, gods, idols, or cults and expect to grow. No other life 
form, including gods, can grow for you. When you have learned to face 
your problems with your own energies given to you through Creation and 
know that you are part of Creation, you can draw on the spiritual force 
that is within you and achieve all that you can imagine. 

It is unfortunate that we are born into a material world unaware of the 
great spiritual knowledge we are connected to. When the Earth human 
learns of the great power and knowledge that is within the spiritual 
subconscious , he will begin to help others in the world with the right kind 
of teaching and guidance so that they can live life to its fullest and most 
rewarding potential. The path to spiritual growth is through the 
recognition of our role within Creation. 

 

The Equality of Man 

It has been said that all men are created equal, and we are. We all start 
as spirit-forms of equal knowledge, or I should say, lack of knowledge, for 
in our beginning state of pure energy we know very little. It is Creation 
that gets us started on our path of growth. 

Once we come into our first lifetime, the learning process starts. We begin 
to accumulate wisdom from our experiences, and we create a path of 
learning that will continue for billions of years as we go through the 
stages of development of human life. All along this path we are learning 
different things at different times. It is the accumulated wisdom that 
contributes to our intellect and our aptitudes, causing us all to be unique 
individuals on our own paths of learning. 


We all need different knowledge at different times because we are on 
separate paths of learning. As we go through life, we slowly learn all of the 
lessons of life, but not at the same time. Eventually all of the lessons are 
learned by everyone, so never can we say that one person is better than 
another; we're just at different levels of learning. It is the wise man who 
recognizes that he is only older, not better, and uses his older self to help 
the younger through love and understanding. The man who uses his older 
self to take advantage of a younger spirit-form, or get ahead at another's 
expense, is living in spiritual stagnation and still has some hard lessons to 
learn. 

Peace will come to Earth when everyone realizes that we are all spiritual 
beings of Creation on our own paths of development, and we make space 
for other spirit-forms so that they can be who they need to be and learn at 
they need to learn for themselves, without any judgment or harassment 
from us. It is the truly enlightened one who recognizes the spirit in his 
fellow man and sees him not as a material being, but as a spirit-form on 
his own path of discovery and learning. 

 

Spiritual Growth 

 

In front of Billy's house there is a patio for guests who visit the Center. 
There is a guest book to sign and five large photo albums you can look 
through and see the most beautiful and clear pictures ever taken of 
Pleiadian or any other spacecraft. The signatures in the guest book are 
from countries all over the world, attesting to the great interest people 
everywhere have about our connection to the family of man throughout the 
universe. 


I had my laptop computer with me and was busy entering in some details 
on what I had learned the past few days when a man came walking up the 
road to the house. He turned out to be from Kansas, where I was born, 
and had heard about Billy and his experiences, like many others, so he 
came for a visit. We had even attended the same college and both had 
majored in psychology. He had gone on to become a professional 
psychologist and started a practice, while I had never used my education 
professionally and had ventured off into private business. 

I had him sign the guest book and offered him some time alone with the 
five photo books while I tried to find someone around the farm for him to 
talk to. During the day it was pretty quiet around the Center because most 
of the F.I.G.U. members worked in town at regular jobs. Billy was in the 
kitchen, but as usual, he wouldn't come out to talk. It had been years since 
he had greeted visitors or answered letters; he had become a real recluse 
as far as the world was concerned. 

Freddy and Silvano were out working in the fields, and Popi, Billy's wife, 
was in town on errands, so our visitor had to settle for me. He could only 
stay for a couple of hours, so I had to do the best I could to answer his 
questions. Since he was a psychologist by profession, he was concerned 
with the development of man and how we think and learn. His questions 
were among the very things I had been studying lately, so it gave me a 
chance to explain it as best I could. I had just been typing information into 
my computer to get things clear in my own head, and now I had a chance 
to try to explain things to a learned man who had studied the science of 
humanity. 

We spent most of the afternoon talking and having a great time examining 
the Pleiadian concepts with principles currently used on Earth by his profession. It 
was an interesting time of discovery for both of us and actually helped me 


to learn through explanation. I had explained the concept of Creation and 
how the universe had developed, but most of his interest was about the 
actual process of spiritual growth; it seemed so different from what was 
currently being taught in our school system. Since we had both gone to the 
same college, I was well aware of what he was talking about. The process 
of spiritual growth as explained by the Pleiadians was quite different from 
what he and I had learned in school. 

 

The Process of Spiritual Growth 

One of the ways that a New Creation contributes to its evolution is through 
the mechanism of spirit-forms, human beings who create material lives to 
learn from. During that learning process, wisdom is obtained through 
experience and adds to the spiritual growth of the individual and the 
evolution of Creation. Wisdom is knowledge that creates energy. The more 
we learn the higher level of energy we provide to ourselves and the 
Creation. The process of spiritual growth at the material level is 
accomplished through the gathering of information with the material 
senses, which is processed by different levels of consciousness, and 
eventually is stored in the spirit as Part of the accumulated wisdom of the 
everlasting spirit. 

This process of spiritual growth is a natural one that goes on whether we 
are aware of it or not. The advantage of understanding the process is that 
we can be in control of the rate of our growth, the quality of information 
we expose ourselves to, and develop methods by which we can live a 
happier life and be in control of our minds. We can also learn to understand 
the purpose of our lives and better understand the path of evolution that 
we are on. You have only to look around you at the millions of people who 


are unhappy, depressed, angry, or out of control, and you can see the 
immediate need for a better understanding of how our spirit works with our 
material self. 

Before we examine the actual process of how we add wisdom to our spirit 
and create evolution, let's have a look at the levels of consciousness that 
will be performing the internal work. Once we know how our spiritual self 
works with our material being, we will see that it is very similar to how 
Creation works with a spirit-form. Creation evolves by creating a Material 
Universe through which it can learn. The universe, a material manifestation 
of the wisdom of Creation, goes through cycles of waking and sleeping 
during which it creates life forms of many types that learn from experience. 
The human spirit-form works the same way and follows the pattern set by 
Creation and the Universe of which it is part of. It creates a material body, 
which goes through cycles of being awake and being asleep, while it learns 
from experience. 

 

How the Mind Works 

Did you know that modem science cannot yet detect the origin of thought? 
We can trace down what part of the material brain the thought is in once it 
causes a synaptic junction to charge. But the origin of thought, that place 
in our mind where the idea comes from, cannot be seen or touched, for it 
isn’t material. The mind is energy, both material and spiritual, and sends 
information to the material brain to be processed to the cells. 

Let's take a look at the general layout of how the spiritual mind and the 
material mind work together. For the sake of our discussion, I have drawn 
a diagram which will help explain how the two minds work together.

On the right side the spiritual self is represented, and on the left is the 
material self. There is no relationship to any part of the physical brain, for 
this chart represents the mind, the area of consciousness where ideas are 
carried out through the action of thoughts. 

Let's start on the left side of the diagram, the material side. Before we 
come into life we are only a spirit-form, but once we are born, we create a 
material body with a brain and develop a material consciousness. In order 
for our body to be able to perceive information, we develop the five senses 
with which we are all familiar: hearing, touch, smell, sight, and taste. You 
will notice on the diagram that these are all attached to the material 


conscious mind. This is how we gather the information which starts the 
learning process. You are exercising your sight right now by reading this 
book. The conscious mind, then, is our connection to the outside world. It 
is how we make decisions; all of our thinking processes, everything that we 
consider, contemplate, and speculate on is done here. This is where all of 
our actual thinking is done. 

Next is the subconscious or unconscious as it is sometimes called. This 
represents the area of consciousness where we store all of the thoughts 
that occur in the conscious mind. All of our feelings, perceptions, all that 
we see, experience, hear, or anything else that penetrates the 
subconscious is stored here. This is the computer control center of the 
mind. It is responsible for guidance, control, and all of the internal 
communication between the different areas of the mind. 

Between the conscious mind and the subconscious, there exists a sensor, 
or filter, that all information passes through. Everything that passes from 
the material conscious to the subconscious passes through this control 
center. All superficial thoughts, including anything that was seen or heard 
superficially, will be blocked and not passed onto the subconscious to be 
stored or considered. Our senses see and hear millions of pieces of 
information that are around us all the time and are of no particular interest 
to us; this unusable superficial information is what is blocked out. For 
instance, if you are sitting at a busy public restaurant with many people 
hurrying about—eating, reading, waiting on tables, cooking, and engaging 
in thousands of pieces of information that your eyes and ears may 
perceive, all this is simply superficial information that you have no need or 
interest in so it is blocked out and not stored. 

We have an internal sensor called a we form by the Pleiadians. It is the 
source of what is called primary telepathy that operates through the ears, 


a kind of hearing that allows one individual to send thoughts and sounds to 
another. It is short range and cannot be used off of the planet. It is most 
effective in close quarters to sense what someone else is feeling or 
thinking. When the phone rings and you think you know who it is, you are 
using the we-form of primary telepathy. That fact that it can sense 
information from many different sources, something like a network or an 
inner telephone, brought to mind the term we form. The person receiving 
telepathic messages can learn to create a block so that others can't pick up 
their thoughts. 

The psyche is a storehouse of feelings which make up our disposition or 
morale. Your emotional feelings and attitudes about the world around you 
are in here. Here is where you will find feelings of sympathy, melancholy, 
cynicism, joy, spite, euphoria, optimism, pessimism, depression, anxiety, 
and fear. From here you may find the feelings of isolation from the world or 
changing the world for the better. The feelings in the psyche help form the 
view that others have of us. 

Since the material consciousness, sub consciousness, and psyche are 
created by the spirit-form, the same levels of consciousness exist on the 
spiritual side as well. The exception is the psyche, for its counterpart on 
the spiritual side is called the gemut. This is a German word which means 
sensor. The gemut has no feelings like the psyche, but it is able to think 
and is the connection we have to outside consciousness, for it is our 
connection to Creation and to levels of higher thinking. Some think of this 
as the silver thread to the life force, or God. 

The spiritual consciousness works much the same and acts as a receiver 
and sender of information to the spiritual subconscious. It works like an 
observer and gets a copy of all that the material senses pick up. 


The spiritual subconscious is a wonderful accumulation of all of the wisdom 
learned from the many material lives lived so far. It has the ability to draw 
upon this resource of information and send hunches to the material side 
when we are trying to make decisions. This hunch is usually the first little 
thought that creeps into our minds when we are trying to make a decision. 

Once man becomes aware that he is more than just physical, he is 
opened up to his real spiritual existence. 

There is also a we-form on the spiritual side which is used for telepathy, 
but it works in a slightly different way. Since information through the 
spiritual we-form is using spiritual force to send and receive, it can 
transcend the normal distance problem and communicate with others 
anywhere in the universe. It has almost no barriers of time or distance and 
is very difficult to block. If one were to receive information from a human 
on a distant star that is where it would come from. The message could be 
sent from many light years away, and it would be so fast that you would 
think the sender was right next to you. Thought is actually much faster 
than light and is almost immeasurable in speed. Since it is spiritual in 
nature, I believe the great speed is due to thoughts being networked 
through the energy of Creation itself, which is everywhere. This is what 
would account for the fact that thoughts can be transmitted almost 
instantly anywhere in the universe. 

Now that we have some idea of different areas of consciousness and 
memory and what they do, let's follow a simple thought from its inception 
and see how the mind works with it. For the sake of this example, let's 
take something that is familiar to all of us—food. Let's go back to our busy 
restaurant and pick up the menu and follow our thoughts as we try to 
make a selection. 


Our eyes have just fallen on the luncheon special, which is beef stew. In a 
split second we read the letters that say, "Luncheon Special – Beef Stew – 
$3.98." That probably took our eyes a second to read. During the space of 
that one second, our material conscious consulted with our subconscious 
millions of times about what it was reading. As the visual image of 
"Luncheon Special – Beef Stew – $3.98" came into view, our conscious 
mind created a visual image of the letters and sent it off to the 
subconscious. It was quickly considered by the filter to determine whether 
the thought was superficial or not, and then passed on to the 
subconscious. The incoming thought, remember, is energy, and as such, it 
is oscillating at a particular vibration. Each time we think, connecting 
impulses are immediately created which determine the vibration of the 
energy and the charge that carries it. 

As soon as the subconscious received the image, it quickly checks in its 
memory to see what kind of data we have on "Luncheon Special – Beef 
Stew – $3.98." If the vibrations of our subconscious memories connected 
to this image are in conformity with the vibrations of the conscious mind, 
the a response is sent back to the conscious mind, via the filter once again, 
that we have similar compatible vibrations, and the conscious mind quickly 
produces a feeling of SYMPATHY. If the new vibrations sent from the 
conscious mind cannot make a connection in the subconscious that is 
agreeable, but instead is of a degenerated or repelling nature, then the 
corresponding impulses will be sent from the subconscious back to the 
conscious via the filter that will cause the thoughts of NONSYMPATHY or 
ANTIPA THY. The thought- of sympathy or antipathy will rise to greater or 
lesser extent, according to the power of the vibrations in question. 

It should be understood that the conscious mind is not capable of creating 
a thought on its own. It cannot form it, develop it further, or execute it if 


corresponding impulses from the subconscious do not stimulate the 
activity. Although the entire information gathering is done by the conscious 
mind, it does not know what to do with the new information if no 
corresponding impulses from the subconscious realm are received. Because 
of this, the conscious mind and the subconscious flash back and forth very 
quickly in order to develop the thought. 

The first reaction may be of familiarity since you have eaten this before and 
liked it, so that memory is in your subconscious and will send sympathetic 
impulses back to the conscious. As soon as the subconscious sends back 
the first impulse, a thought begins to build in the conscious mind. It will 
continue to flash back and forth at incredible speeds as new information 
comes in, and the thought builds. 

The conscious mind begins to build a thought and continues to add new 
information from the eyes, ears, nose, hands, and mouth. Perhaps your 
nose picks up the smell of the stew; that is added to the information and 
your subconscious will send impulses about the smell, letting you know if it 
likes it or not. Your eyes may see an order of stew on the next table, and 
that visual image is added; did it look good or not? Perhaps the person 
you're with mentions they got sick on the stew last week, and that figures 
into the thought you are building. Within just a second or two, a million 
pieces of data can be flashed back and forth to build the thought. 

Just as you are starting to form a thought about whether or not you should 
order the stew, you find out that the cook who made the stew is someone 
you really dislike. Now you have an immediate negative reaction and send 
very negative vibrational impulses to the subconscious which will, in turn, 
respond quite negatively. The thought of this person quickly triggers deep-
seated emotions of hostility and anger in your psyche, and adds that to the 
flashes of bad memory in your subconscious, and then sends all of that 


back to your conscious mind. Within a split second your entire mood 
changes, and you have no interest in the stew or the restaurant, and you 
want to leave. 

One's negative thoughts can be very disruptive to a situation. Now you are 
leaving a restaurant where you have been enjoying the food for weeks, 
just because it is cooked by someone you don't like. As you bolt for the 
door, your anger causes you to bump into the waiter and knock over his 
tray and, without excusing yourself, you race out the door. Your mind has 
just been through billions of flashes, mood swings, emotions, and 
thoughts. Within the space of a few seconds your whole atmosphere has 
changed, all because of a negative thought that you created. 

Your conscious mind and your subconscious process new data and create 
thoughts like this continually all during your waking state. The memory of 
these events is stored in your subconscious and serves to influence the 
emotions and feelings in your psyche. As you sleep at night, your conscious 
mind is quiet while your subconscious is still active, sorting out the events 
of the day and coming to terms with them. 

If you had remained upset the rest of the day and had gone to bed in that 
state of mind, you would have gotten very little sleep because our 
subconscious would have kept dealing with your out-of-balance state until 
exhaustion finally set in, causing sleep. Even then you would not have slept 
well, for your subconscious would have been trying to solve things, and it 
would have been sending impulses back to your conscious mind, causing it 
to think and keeping you from a deep sleep. 

Our spiritual side never sleeps and is paying attention to what we are doing 
at all times. Each time a thought flashes back and forth between our 
conscious and subconscious, the spiritual side is listening to see if we are 


learning anything. So far the events of the day have not been added to our 
spiritual subconscious, where the accumulated wisdom is cored. Spiritual 
growth is adding wisdom learned from experience to our spiritual 
subconscious, which will be carried forward through lifetimes. In order to 
do this, it is necessary that we learn from our experiences and make that 
new knowledge part of us. Once we have full cognition of knowledge and 
integrate it into our life causing change, then our spirit will add it to our 
spiritual growth if our new wisdom is correct, according to Creation. Let's 
see how that works in this instance. 

You had a sleepless night of worry over how you acted the previous day 
and decided to go back to the restaurant to apologize to the waiter. As you 
are expressing how sorry you are for your actions and trying to explain 
how it won't happen again, the cook walks in the front door. Seizing the 
opportunity to cleanse yourself even further, you have a long talk with the 
cook, during which you find out you have been mad at him because of 
misinformation. There really hasn't been any reason to dislike him; it had 
all been a misunderstanding, so after some discussion you finish the 
conversation as friends. Walking away, you feel a great relief as the 
negative energy dissipates, and you have learned something about anger 
and how to deal with it. You even admitted you were wrong and faced up 
to the fact that your anger was uncalled for, and in the process, you 
discovered a new friend. You feel pretty good about yourself and even sit 
down and have the "Luncheon Special — Beef Stew — $3.98." 

This new experience is also recorded in your material subconscious; you 
have made some progress in the emotional department as well, causing 
the psychic illness of anger to subside just a little. As the following days 
come and go and other situations arise that normally would have caused 
you to fly off in anger, you now deal with them with a new attitude. You 


have learned how to control your anger and have made a difference in your 
life that will stay with you. The wisdom from this new experience will be 
recorded in your spiritual subconscious. This is wisdom from experience 
that is added to your accumulated knowledge, and it will move forward 
from lifetime to lifetime. The lesson may have to be repeated several times 
to really heal your psyche, but now you're on the right track. 

Psychic illness is a buildup of emotions which are so negative that we can't 
live our life normally. Jealousy is about the worst condition to fall into. The 
many events that lead up to a person becoming completely jealous make 
this state of emotional imbalance very difficult to recover from. 

Psychic illness is caused by the illogical thinking of the conscious mind, 
which slowly creates the emotions through a buildup of negative thinking. 
When we are born, our psyche is clean and healthy. No one is born full of 
anger, depression, anxiety, or jealousy; these are all man-made emotions 
that are created from not being able to handle life's experiences in a 
healthy manner. 

If a person can learn to think in a neutral manner, instead of negative or 
positive, then he will not create the harmful emotions which rule our 
psychic feelings. Neutral thinking is the ability to clearly see things as they 
are without attaching negative or positive judgments to the thought. If we 
had just seen the Beef Stew as nothing more than just food in a bowl and 
had not attached any other emotions or feelings to it, we could have had a 
peaceful lunch with no problems. It was the process of attaching a negative 
thought to it that caused the difficulty. It is not healthy to attach overly-
positive thoughts to things either, for they can cause just as much damage 
in over-inflated egos or attitudes. In the New Age we will all learn more 
about how to see the world around us in a neutral way, and live without 
psychic illness. 


It is very difficult in our current world to grow up without creating many 
negative emotions due to all of the trauma we go through as children. 
Many adults would agree that most of their emotional problems stem, in 
part, from a difficult childhood that created emotions which still play a part 
in their behavior. We are born into a society that does not understand us 
spiritually. There is no understanding of how we left the last life and what 
problems we may have starting this one. No one is concerned that we are 
spirits on a path of learning and need something special. Our society 
teaches that children are possessions to be disciplined and corrected. More 
than 50% of the young children in America today are victims of some kind 
of child abuse, most of it physical. Currently more than one-third of all 
children are born into single-parent families, and they will be denied the 
natural order of learning that comes from two parents. We are creating an 
entire generation of young adults who will not benefit from the necessary 
role-modeling from that missing mom or dad. We can only guess what 
effect that may have on our society. 

For those children who are lucky enough to have understanding parents 
who make an effort to try to comprehend the unique qualities of each child, 
they will grow up with far fewer problems. When we are young and 
impressionable, our psyches are forming, and our subconscious is just 
building its vast memory bank that we will draw from throughout our lives. 
If we can go through our childhoods being loved and understood and are 
taught how to think correctly, life will be one great festival of joy and 
happiness instead of a burden of emotional trauma. 

If, however, we wind up as adults who cannot control our thinking, life will 
be a burden of emotional pain. We would then find ourselves riding a roller 
coaster of negative and positive thoughts, causing our moods to constantly 
change. Having no control over our thinking, we would have a different 


opinion on things every day, making decisions almost impossible. Even 
though most of the world is caught up in this mode of illogical thinking, 
there is hope, because it can be reversed. 

Psychic illness can be corrected through the slow process of reestablishing 
logical thinking. The conscious mind can then start to build new thoughts 
which will, in turn, create new experiences from more neutral thinking. 
These new experiences will reeducate our emotions, and our psyche will 
slowly repair itself. 

Reeducating a psyche is slow work and can be very demanding. It takes 
the help of another person who is a more logical and clear thinker, for the 
stricken person is not capable of helping himself in the beginning. You 
cannot repair a thinking problem with the same illogical thoughts that 
created the problem. 

The food our spirit lives on is truth according to Creation. 

Healing a person of psychic illness means healing through the powers of 
the spirit. Individuals must activate their own spirit to heal themselves. 
This means the power of their spirit must be motivated and become useful. 
The process of healing requires long explanations of pure logic which will 
motivate people to think correctly and use their own spirit. In effect, 
people wishing to heal themselves of psychic illness must be prepared to 
do a lot of thinking, because the people helping them cannot take over the 
mental work of others. It is only possible to give them a start in the right 
direction, but the ailing people must heal themselves. It is the mind that 
must learn to think correctly so that it will form new understandings and 
feelings. 

It is not possible to simply erase old memories and feelings so that 
everything will go away. The old memories and experiences must be 


replaced with new ones. The ailing person must first learn to understand 
exactly what the problem is, and then be led into new thinking through the 
aid of visual images so that they may have new experiences to replace the 
old ones. 

In the case of psychiatry, words of logic and self-discovery are relied on 
too much. The subconscious reacts better to images and visions, not word. 
Only the conscious mind can use words, and they can be misunderstood or 
misinterpreted by the ailing person. It is words from which we create 
visions and images. If we are sick, we will hear words and create images 
and visions that are negative or illogical, so progress is slow. Many people 
take the guidance of a psychiatrist for months and years and make little or 
no progress, since the treatment seldom goes past the stage of words on a 
couch. 

On the other hand, if you take an ailing individual out of his environment, 
away from all of the normal surroundings that he is used to, and give him 
a new environment with unfamiliar surroundings, he will have to 
immediately create all new responses to deal with this new situation. Then, 
if he is guided correctly with neutral thinking as he creates these new 
thoughts, experiences, and feelings, he will become a new person in a very 
short time. Old memories and emotions will be replaced quickly. 

If a person is spiritually weak and suffering and you are strong in spirit and 
healthy in mind, you can try letting them use your strength while they get 
theirs back. This can be done by the laying on of hands around the body in 
the region of the stricken person's aura. The aura is the field of energy 
around each person's body that reflects the condition of the spiritual 
energy. As you think, your thoughts create energy that shows in the aura 
around your body. If a person is sick, it will show in their aura. 


If you are strong, you can let your aura mix with theirs. Hold your hands 
around them in their auric field for several minutes, perhaps hours, and 
they will benefit from it. The power of your healthy spirit can help theirs 
get started. Sometimes just the feeling of your healthy energy is enough to 
make them feel better about themselves, and pull them out of depression 
or despair. You must be cautious to not absorb negative energies from 
them. This can happen if you are doing this because of ego or vanity, 
rather than love and genuine concern for another. If you try to help 
someone in order to show off or prove that you are very spiritual, you will 
do them no good and only hurt yourself. If, on the other hand, you are 
giving from your heart and expect nothing in return and think with a clear 
and logical mind, you can be of great help to another. When you are acting 
with your ego, you are spiritually weak and cannot protect yourself 
adequately; however, a spiritually balanced person is strong and will suffer 
no ill-effects. 

 

Our Connection to Creation 

On our spiritual side, we also have the ability to be in connection with 
Creation through the gemut. When our spirit-form was created, our 
connection to the Creation was made through this special sensor. While our 
spirit is listening to our thoughts and accepting wisdom into the 
subconscious, it always has the ability to use the gemut to check out our 
ideas with Creation. It is like an open line that is always there for us, and it 
can only be felt through the spirit. Our spiritual self will not accept any 
wisdom to be added to our accumulated consciousness unless it first 
checks with Creation through the gemut to be sure it is in line with the 
truth. It is Creation that lays down the laws of evolution and creates the 
framework for man to live by. If man could learn to think with his 


conscious mind, using these laws of conduct provided by Creation, not only 
would his life be easier, but his evolution as a spirit-form would progress 
much faster. 

In religions and different belief structures there is always the faith factor, 
for it is not possible to prove that God really exists. It is something that 
you take on faith because our parents or the priest at our church told us 
so. If you want to prove to yourself that Creation exists, and that it is the 
ultimate source of love and understanding which can provide all knowledge 
that is necessary for life, then you have only to make your connection to 
the Great Eternity through the gemut. Here you can feel and experience for 
yourself the ultimate feeling of the life force that guides all things, and it is 
available to you at any time you choose, without going through any 
ceremonies, spiritual leaders, guides, or forms of worship. You are always 
connected to it, for you are a part of it. 

 

The Akashic Records 

Earlier I mentioned that thoughts are energy. As your mind builds a 
thought through the millions of flashes between the conscious, she 
subconscious, and the psyche, it becomes a charge of energy. The 
vibrations of this energy are dependent on the level of evolution of the 
spirit that makes it and the emotions and feelings that helped create it. We 
are normally used to thinking that our thoughts are safely tucked away 
inside of our heads where no one else will know about them. This is true to 
a certain extent, or those around us will have no idea of them. However, 
our thoughts do not dissipate or disappear inside of our head someplace. 
Once the thought is created and becomes energy, it has the ability to leave 
our mind and move out into space. As it does this, it rises up off the planet 


and becomes part of a band of etheric energy that circles the planet called 
the akashic records. This energy band is called "records," for it contains 
thoughts from all who have lived on Earth throughout history and stores 
them in a very logical way, based on the level of evolution. 

The akashic records are the knowledge of the past. Here the thoughts of 
everyone are arranged in layers of memory. Each layer or level of memory 
is a different level of evolution. Remember that thoughts are energy, and 
the energy is separated by the level of its oscillating vibrations. There is an 
akashic record around a planet just for those thoughts; there is also an 
akashic record around a solar system, and one around a galaxy. There may 
be others that I'm not familiar with. These are the only ones the Pleiadians 
have mentioned. 

The knowledge of the past is protected, so getting into it is not easy. One 
must earn that right by virtue of your understanding of how the spirit 
works. It is only accessible through the subconscious of the spirit which 
activates the we-form on the spiritual side. Once you have learned how to 
activate your subconscious through meditation, you will also discover that 
you will need to learn the "key" to get in. 

A key is a special symbol understood by the spirit that can unlock a 
particular memory level in the records. This key can only be discovered 
through meditation since it is part of the symbol language of spirit. Once 
you have learned a key that can open a particular record, you can then 
gain access to those thoughts. Opening a record allows you access to the 
thought is of that person which are stored there. This is how you can learn 
about another person's thinking. The information you will have access to 
cannot be of higher evolution than your own. So even if you were to try 
and access information created by some great thinker like DaVinci, you 
would only be able to access his thoughts that were not of any greater 


evolution than your own. This is because your mind creates energy that 
oscillates at a certain frequency determined by your evolution. The higher 
the evolution, the higher the frequency. Frequencies created by your mind 
cannot unlock records that require a higher frequency. This is Creation's 
way of protecting knowledge until you are ready for it. Even if you 
somehow could get information of a much higher evolution sent to you, 
there would be a problem of reception. Depending on how high it was, you 
either couldn't receive it, or it would make you crazy, angry, or emotionally 
push you beyond your limits. You could even get physically hurt from being 
overloaded by frequencies that are too high for your mind to handle. It's 
kind of like a radio that is only capable of handling incoming frequencies up 
to a certain level. Anything above that level is either missed all together or 
distorted. 

Information from the akashic cannot be spoken, but can only be 
transmitted through writing or drawing. 

Once you are able to access thoughts from DaVinci, your spirit acts as a 
receiver and thinks like DaVinci while it is connected. Since this is a 
spiritual connection, not a material one, the information cannot be spoken 
but can be written down as in auto-writing or auto-painting. It is not 
uncommon for some people to have a connection to the akashic and be 
able to receive information without even knowing where it is coming from. 
If you speak to these people, they will tell you that they use meditation 
and a key or symbol of some kind to start the transmission. 

The akashic can be accessed through meditation. It is not the spirit world, 
but the records of past knowledge. The spirit-forms, who created the 
thoughts that are there, are now living new lives as different personalities. 
When you are in the akashic records, you are not in connection with 
DaVinci, just his thoughts that were recorded when he was alive. The spirit 


that lived a lifetime as DaVinci has now moved on and created another life 
as a new personality and is no longer DaVinci. It is only his thoughts that 
are left behind. 

 

Heaven—the Other Side 

The akashic should not be confused with the other side, the sleeping place 
of spirits. This is an entirely different area that can only be accessed by 
spirit and requires a different technique. The Pleiadians do not interfere 
with the other side, and feel it is better to leave sleeping spirits alone. For 
one thing, these spirits do not know any more than they did when they 
were here, and they usually don't want to be bothered anyway. Psychics 
that claim to be in touch with dead or sleeping spirits are usually in touch 
with the akashic records of that spirit and don't even know it. The minds of 
Earthmen were scanned by the Pleiadians, and they discovered that only 
sixteen people on Earth have the evolution and the understanding to 
actually get in touch with the other side at will. Many people receive 
images, feelings, or thoughts from spirits, but cannot initiate it themselves; 
they are only receiving. To the Pleiadians and their level of morality, they 
feel it best to leave the other side alone. 


Telepathy 

The Pleiadians use a form of telepathy to send information to thousands of 
people on Earth all the time. They have been very open about the fact that 
they're trying to help with our education by sending us ideas and visions 
that we can use. They are hopeful that by doing this, the ideas will 
stimulate people to use their Higher Selves and educate others who will 
make a difference in our world. This information is normally sent to us so 


that we can receive it during our sleep through our we-form on the 
material side. This means that we may pick up ideas and thoughts while we 
dream and believe they are our own. 

The Pleiadians feel it is morally wrong for them to invade our thoughts and 
impinge on our free will. If they do not allow us to know the origin of the 
thoughts, then we will think they are our own ideas. Hundreds of small 
telemeter crafts of various sizes listen to our thinking and broadcast 
thoughts for us to pick up. In 1975 they admitted that currently over 
17,000 people were receiving their transmissions. They have not told us 
who these people are or how they select them. 

Other travelers from other worlds could also be sending us information as 
well. In many cases the receiving party may have become aware of the 
source of these transmissions, for the senders may wish to identify 
themselves. We should also be cautious, though, as many people create 
these connections in their fantasies and are in touch with nothing but their 
egos. In any case, we should always be careful about information and 
never worship or give special recognition to any source of data. Always 
treat information for just what it is without glorifying it. It can be very 
exciting to be in touch with other life forms, but be aware that not all of 
them are friendly and have your best interests at heart. Imagine the 
psychic pain you could put yourself through if you allowed yourself to be 
used by another life form for their use against your own people. An 
invasion from outer space may not come in ships, but in the minds of our 
people. 

Not only do we receive information from the Pleiadians and other races, 
but from each other. Remember the we-form on the material side is a form 
of hearing that can also detect the thoughts of those around us. We pick up 
feelings and impressions when we are around people. For instance, if you 


were around someone who was thinking negative or harmful thoughts 
about you, your we-form would pick it up. Depending on your sensitivity, 
you would probably feel this and react in fear, caution, apprehension, or 
anger. You would want to get away from this person as soon as possible. 
We are constantly receiving feelings and impressions from the people 
around us. Our subconscious is busy defending itself from outside thoughts 
all the time, without our awareness. There are over five billion people on 
Earth who are thinking all sorts of thoughts that create energy we have to 
deal with. This energy also affects the animals and nature. We are told by 
the Pleiadians that in some cases earthquakes and storms can be started 
just by the extra negative energy from the mass consciousness of Earth 
people, which disturbs nature. 

The we-form on our spiritual side also can be used to make connections 
with other life forms. It is dormant in most people since they don't even 
know it is there. It has the ability to move thoughts in symbol form over 
vast distances in space. If a Pleiadian wanted to send you a thought from 
their home planet of Erra, then this is how they would do it. The thought 
would come to you on the spiritual side, since telepathy on the material 
side is only for short distances on the planet. The problem that you would 
have is that the information comes in symbol form, and you wouldn't 
understand it. It takes years of practice in meditation to learn and 
understand the many different symbols that are necessary to translate 
incoming transmissions. 

Here on Earth we also need to know that beings of higher intelligence can 
send information in thought-form into our subconscious without us knowing 
about it. Since the subconscious is where your memory is, you would think 
the new thought is your own. For instance, it would be possible to implant 
a thought in your mind that you have been taken aboard a ship and 


interacted with extraterrestrials about a special mission they want you to 
perform. It is not necessary for this experience to have ever happened. 
The entire experience could be put into your memory, and you would 
believe it really happened. You would argue with anyone that it is real, for 
you have no way of doubting it yourself. To you it is an actual memory, as 
clear as any other thought. This happens in many cases where ETs want 
someone on Earth to do something for them. Our minds can be controlled 
by higher intelligences, and we can do nothing about it because we are 
underdeveloped as thinkers. It is very hard to block information which 
comes in through the we-form on the material side, especially if you don't 
even know that it is happening. If you knew it was happening and wanted 
to block it, you could, but you would have to be a very powerful, clear 
thinker with good meditation experience. However, these are not the 
people who are chosen. 

A Real Time Vision is one that is experienced in actual time, and 
cannot be discerned from reality. 

 

Channeling 

Occasionally someone tells us that they are in touch with beings from the 
spirit world or other planets and that these beings are going to speak to 
us through them. This process is called channeling. It is typical for the 
person performing the channeling to speak to us in a different voice, as if 
it were the personality of the incoming being. 

The Pleiadians do not ever communicate in this manner because they 
know it is too inaccurate. They have been quite clear that in no case do 
they allow the person receiving information to know where it comes from. 
Because there are so many different ways that we can receive information 


from outside sources, it is easy to see how anyone could be confused 
about the origin. We receive information through the material we-form, 
the spiritual we-form, the gemut, psychic connection to one another, and 
transmissions from other intelligences such as the Pleiadians that enter 
our subconscious as we sleep or daydream. Then if we add the fact that 
our conscious mind makes up its own thoughts from the psyche and the 
subconscious, it is easy to see how the origin of information can be very 
hard to pin down. I think that people who channel are receiving 
information; they are just not aware of where it is really coming from. 

If you want to learn to channel, you start with learning meditation and how 
to enter into a concentration. At some point the individual will suddenly 
make a connection somewhere and start speaking with a different 
personality or voice. Anyone who tries this should be cautious. When you 
start to learn meditation, you must be careful to avoid letting the ego come 
into play because it will manufacture anything you want, fulfilling your 
dreams or wishes, and it is done using the emotions and feelings from your 
psyche. 

One of the natural pitfalls to learning meditation is the tendency to create 
images from your own subconscious rather than creating clear dream 
images in the awakened state from the spirit. If meditation is done 
correctly, the first achievement will be the occurrence of vague and at first, 
incoherent forms of dream images in the waking state without 
concentrating upon such images or wishing to see something. These 
images are distinguishable from the usual dream images by their extreme 
clarity and distinctness. They also do not exhibit any power of suggestion 
and will gradually begin to link up with logical forms. The sure sign you are 
doing meditation wrong is when a different personality begins to appear. In 
almost every case the person channeling is only accessing areas of his own 


subconscious, which may contain information from many sources. 

Channeling can be termed euphoric meditation. In other words, you are 
practicing meditation incorrectly and are producing the effect of the second 
personality from your ego. This can be very dangerous, especially if the 
individual continues this and lets his ego get out of hand. It can lead to 
schizophrenia, a condition of psychic illness that is very difficult to recover 
from, causing the individual to no longer be able to distinguish realty 
clearly. 

If you want to access information from other sources, learn to meditate 
correctly and use the we-form. No alter-ego voice or personality is required 
to receive telepathy or visions through the spirit. It is only necessary to 
learn to enter a meditative concentration deep enough to use your own 
spiritual force. I have heard many channelers and found no information 
that could not be expressed using a simple meditative technique. I believe 
when the information comes in through the foreign voice, it is only being 
manufactured by the individual himself. 

People who show good psychic abilities are often in touch with other people 
or life forms; for they are sensitive to certain frequencies whore reception 
of thought energy is possible. Good psychics take advantage of meditative 
abilities, but never use a channeled voice to communicate. They are in a 
wakened state of concentration and use their spiritual force to make 
connections. 

 

Reincarnation 

As we come close to the end of our material lives, there is an inner 
awareness that knows when death will come. Buried within our 
subconscious is the knowledge of our life span. Our spirit has the 


knowledge of how long our material life should be and when we will pass 
away. This is due in part to the amount of life force the spirit has to sustain 
the material life, and in part to its ability to transcend time and know what 
lies ahead. 

Fear of death is a result of not knowing what will happen to us after we die. 
Most religions and belief systems tell us we are going to heaven or hell 
where we will be judged, disciplined, burned, or who knows what, 
depending on how we have obeyed their laws. Fear of going to hell and 
burning forever, or not being able to get into heaven if you sin in the eyes 
of your priest, is a very strong motivator and gives religions control over 
millions of people. Fortunately, they are wrong, for these mythical places 
are only the inventions of those who would control you here in the material 
world. 

Onboard a Pleiadian craft there are instruments which allow a person's 
spiritual self to be shown on a view screen, which contains knowledge 
about the time of birth, purpose in life, karmic debts, past-life trauma, and 
he expected time of death among other things. This information can be 
read and studied for a better understanding of your life. 

The device also has the ability to read the feelings and thoughts of your 
conscious and subconscious mind. As an example of how foolish the fear of 
death is, an older man who was close to death was chosen, and his 
spiritual self was projected on the screen. First his conscious mind was 
read, and the thoughts of his fear of death were very strongly displayed. 
He was dying of heart disease and was in a lot of pain. He had lived most 
of his life a soldier and had been responsible for the deaths of thousands of 
people. Now he was close to his own death and was behaving like a 
coward, for fear had overcome him. His life had been one of purely 
material gains, power, greed, and control over others. He had never taken 


the time to get in touch with his spirit, touched Creation, or felt the love of 
those around him. 

Changing the screen so it now showed his subconscious revealed that the 
fear was gone. His conscious mind was almost paralyzed in fear, but his 
subconscious was fairly peaceful. This is because the subconscious 
understands what the afterlife is and knows that death is no great horror, 
but only a change into the other side for a time of rest and reunion with 
the Creation. The Pleiadians do not see death as an ending, but only a 
transition in the endless path of spiritual growth that is a natural part of 
our evolution. 

We have the ability to have an effect on our next life in some ways. We can 
make conscious decisions about our choice of gender, for instance. If you 
have lived a life as a woman and wish to return as a man, this is possible 
through generating the will to do so in your spiritual self. Subconsciously 
we make the decision on gender based on lessons that we are trying to 
learn or experiences we are trying to have. If, during our material life, we 
have become confused about our gender through emotional trauma or 
other experiences that make us unstable about our sexuality, we may 
leave the material world in a confused state. If this happens, we will 
continue to be confused on the other side, for the programming or 
decision- making needs to be made in the material life. When we return to 
the material world, the state of confusion will lead us to be born as a 
homosexual. This confusion of spirit will also play a hand in the 
development of the body and certain areas of the brain that affect sexual 
attraction. Since this is a form of illogical thinking and confusion on the 
part of the spirit, it can be dealt with during the material life through a 
slow process of logical thinking and experience allowing the individual to 
discover his sexuality and reprogram himself. For a person experiencing 


sexual confusion, it is important to program your spirit as to your sexual 
preference while still alive, as this will control how you will return in the 
next life and end the confusion. 

Once the death process begins, our material senses begin to deteriorate 
and stop functioning. Medical death occurs when the heartbeat can no 
longer be detected, and we are pronounced dead. Even though we appear 
dead and our material body is no longer functioning, the spirit may stay in 
the body for up to 72 hours before it leaves. In most cases the spirit will 
separate and leave quickly. There are many cases on record where 
witnesses have seen a wisp of energy or felt something pass by them as 
the spirit leaves the body. Scientifically it is even possible to weigh the 
body after death and measure the weight loss after the spirit has departed. 
It is believed by some that the spirit energy somehow inhabits small 
organelles in our bodies called nisel bodies. Nisel bodies are not material, 
but are energy bodies that store the life force energy. When a person dies, 
the nisel bodies disappear also. If you were to examine a dead cell within a 
living body, you would find that the nisel bodies in the dead cell would be 
gone. 

The spirit, however, does not die and is very busy taking over the 
conscious awareness of the self as the material senses are shutting down. 
While this happens, the spiritual conscious begins to see the light of 
Creation, and a feeling of love and comfort are immediately felt. Thoughts 
of the material pain and discomfort fade immediately because the material 
brain is no longer functioning. All thoughts, emotions, fears, anxieties, 
hate, and other man-made feelings that have been manufactured 
throughout the material lifetime fade away as the material self is ending. 

Having advanced thousands of years beyond us in spiritual understanding, 
the Pleiadians have studied the passing over of spirits in great detail. They 


want us to know that our spirit does not leave the planet and on to a 
heaven or to a hell. It stays right here on Earth where it started. Our spirit-
forms came out of Creation and are evolving with the planet, and they stay 
with it. Our akashic records are only on this planet and are connected to 
us. It is not possible, at our level of evolution, for us to be born on another 
world or dimension. We simply do not have the ability. 

Our spirits rest in the band of energy around the planet the Pleiadians call 
the other side, which is right here with us, only in energy form. Once we 
pass over, our spirits are still conscious and are aware of the material 
world for awhile. If we have lived a long time and have died a peaceful 
death when our time has come, we will slip into rest easily and naturally. 

We are spiritual beings living a series of material lives in order 
to evolve. 

If we have died unexpectedly from an apparent accident, murder, or 
traumatic event, we could be uncomfortable for awhile and may not even 
reach the other side. In these cases the spirit may not recognize that it is 
dead, or may not want to die, and will slip into another material being 
instead of passing over into the other side. This will cause the invaded 
person to become confused in spirit and may immediately start showing 
signs of unusual behavior. Even pronounced personality traits may shift, 
for the incoming spirit doesn't know where it is and is trying to send 
messages to the material self. 

Professional psychologists are discovering that there are many cases of this 
happening. Methods of hypnosis have been developed which are effective 
in making the incoming spirit aware that it is in another body, and that it is 
time for it to let go and pass over to the other side. Doctors dealing with 
this problem actually counsel the confused spirit, letting it know that death 


has come and that they are in another material body by mistake. In most 
cases, once the incoming spirit understands what has happened, it will 
immediately let go and pass over, relieving the individual of the confusion 
of spirit and returning them to normal thinking. There are thousands of 
cases of this phenomenon on record, providing a wealth of new knowledge 
about the spiritual world. 

Once on the other side, the spirit will rest for a period of time that is 
dependent on two factors. If you have lived a long life and have adder a 
great deal of wisdom to your spirit, you will come back very slowly. If you 
have lived a short life and have learned very little, you will come back 
more quickly. This is Creation's way of balancing out the evolution of the 
human spirit-forms on a planet. 

The time on the other side follows the pattern set by Creation as it evolves 
through cycles of waking and sleeping. The sleep period on the other side 
is a time of rest and contemplation. No new experiences are gained; that is 
only in the material realm. The wisdom learned from the material lifetime 
is considered, or cogitated, and the process of evolution for the spirit 
continues. 

Once the rest period starts, the spirit is no more aware of the material 
world than we are of the spiritual world. Communication is possible if you 
know how, and in some cases thoughts do transfer, but for the most part 
the spirit has no interest in the material realm. When we are alive and 
sleep at night, our material senses are off, and we are not aware of the 
material world. We are busy finishing out the thoughts of the day or 
traveling through time and space in our dreams. Awareness of the material 
returns when we wake up in the morning and begin to use our conscious 
minds again. Our time on the other side is very much like this. 


The other side has different levels of consciousness. When we first enter, 
we are at a level where we finish out the thoughts and feelings of the 
lifetime. The majority of the time is spent here, and then we will move 
through two more levels of consciousness before we are ready to return to 
a material life. 

The average time on the other side is 152 years on Earth. This is an 
average time, taking into consideration all of the spirits here. This time can 
vary, of course, as stated before, depending on the length of the material 
life and its attainment. In this time of the New Age, the turn-around time 
speeds up on the one hand due to the increase in the vibrations of energy 
affecting the planet, but mostly because of the tremendous problem of 
overpopulation. It is possible that some spirits may return in as quickly as 
15 years. 

Once our spirit has passed through the three levels of consciousness on the 
other side, it signals the Creation that it is ready to return to the material 
realm. This signal is somehow connected to the spiritual life force, which is 
now rested, and to the clarity of thought that has resulted from finishing 
out its thinking from the previous life. 

The Creation has a hand in actually moving the spirit into a material body 
once it is ready. It is the physical mother in the material realm that 
provides the window of opportunity for it to happen. There is a tendency of 
a spirit to try to stay within its own family, if possible. So if the timing is 
right and a female member of the family is pregnant and the spirit is 
ready, Creation moves its hand and the spirit enters the womb. 

Considering the average turn-around time is 152 years, this means that 
your children may have also been your great, great, great, grandmother 
about six or seven generations back. Here in the New Age, where spirits 


will be coming back sooner, there is a chance of your children being your 
departed parents or grandparents. 

If all spirits lived a long and full life, the family chain would almost follow a 
normal order of things. Unfortunately, due to wars and other reasons, 
spirits live a shorter life; the normal chain of births gets interrupted 
frequently on Earth, and people are born into the family out of their normal 
birth sequence. In my case, for instance, I was informed that the 
Pleiadians felt that I was late in my birth and missed my normal place; I 
should have been a child of my grandmother. This means that my mother 
normally would have been my sister if events had gone right. This 
interruption of the normal cycle can cause problems in one's growth as a 
material person. 

The spirit will move into the material body within twenty-one days of 
conception. On a Pleiadian world they have the ability to know when the 
spirit has made its decision and will no longer permit abortion after that. 
Once the spirit has made its decision to come in and contact has been 
made to find out who the spirit is, this is the beginning of the new life. If 
there is an abortion once the spirit is in the womb, it will return very 
quickly into another, possibly within hours or days. When we reach this 
level of knowledge here on Earth, we will see a change in morality and a 
different view on abortion. 

The first choice of Creation is that the spirit comes into a window of 
opportunity that is as close as possible to the same level of evolution as 
the spirit. For this and other reasons of stability, the family chain is the 
first consideration. If the spirit is moved out of its family, as millions are on 
Earth, it causes a more difficult time during the material life. The positive 
side is that this can provide for many new things to be learned. 


Once the spirit is in the mother, it is a very exciting time for both her and 
the person coming in. To begin with, the mother should try to be aware 
during the first twenty-one days when the spirit actually makes the 
decision to come into her body. Developing your spiritual force through 
meditation will help you make the contact and discover that a person is 
coming back into life. It is not being created from scratch, but has probably 
lived as many lives as you have and is now creating a new life. Be aware 
that it may be a family member from a long time past. You could study 
your family tree and see who passed away over a hundred years ago. If 
you can find pictures of your older relatives, you could meditate on their 
images and you may make some connections. Image how wonderful it 
would be to discover who the spirit was in previous lives and how they had 
lived. If you knew what kind of life they lived and how they died, you could 
create a special bond with them before they were born. Communication 
could begin with the new person letting you know what to name them. 
Names reflect the level of evolution and the path of learning we are on. 
Names have meaning in spiritual language and will present themselves to 
the mother if she is open to it. 

By realizing that babies are people creating new lives for themselves, we 
should no longer think of them as possessions that we have made, but as 
people coming into a new life. Life is a cooperative effort by the mother, 
the father, and the incoming person. The father provides his DNA along 
with the mother's to begin the formation of the material body. It begins 
with the spine as the body begins to form. During the eighth to the 
fifteenth week, the brain is forming and creating all of the connectors it will 
need for thinking. It is at this time that the spirit of the incoming person 
starts to take a hand in the formation of this new body. It is the spirit that 
provides the mapping or information to the DNA on how many brain 


connectors to create. The spiritual self knows how much accumulated 
knowledge it will bring into the new body and how many brain connectors 
it will need to handle the intelligence and aptitudes that will flow in. If you 
have learned lessons in a particular area in previous lives, the wisdom from 
those experiences are carried forward into your new life, so you can benefit 
from them. This is the determining factor in why we all have different 
intelligence and aptitude. Millions of years ago we all did start off equally—
equally ignorant, that is—but as our evolution continues; we all learn 
different things at different times, so our accumulated wisdom is 
diversified. So you see, none of us are any better than anyone else, just 
younger or older. It's like going through school and being in different 
grades. We all go through the same classes and eventually graduate; we 
just get there at different times. We judge each other or try to sound like 
we are better than another to make ourselves feel or appear important. In 
actuality, we are only younger or older than each other on our own paths 
of evolution. 

The accumulated knowledge of our previous lives is stored within our 
spiritual subconscious and is always available to us if we use it. We also 
benefit from it another way. Once the brain is formed and the connectors 
are all functional, the spirit makes a copy of its wisdom and puts it into the 
acids of our brain for the material body to use. We are also connected to 
Creation through our spiritual gemut sensor. We have our spiritual 
subconscious to help guide us. We have our spiritual we-form to connect us 
to the akashic records of our past thoughts, and we have wisdom from our 
previous lives in the acids of our brain. All of these connections are there to 
help us in our new material life. 

The material for the most part is a product of the DNA of our mother and 
father, the family genetics. The spirit, though, is reflected across the face. 


If you could see pictures of your previous lives, you would notice that 
across the eyes you would look similar. 

This fascinated me when I first heard it, and I thought how unfortunate 
that photography has only been around for a short time; otherwise, we 
could all have pictures of our relatives from hundreds of years ago, and we 
could see this phenomenon for ourselves. Because of my interest in this, 
one of the ladies at the Center showed me a picture of a Russian woman 
who lived about 160 years ago and asked me to look at it carefully. I 
studied the picture for a moment and then glanced back at the lady. It 
was her. Even though the hair was a different color and the face was a 
little different, you could see the same eyes, nose, and ears across the 
face. She had been guided by the Pleiadians to understand this and had 
found this picture of herself in a previous life. 

The moment of birth is very important on a Pleiadian world. At the 
moment that the soft spot on our skull bursts forth and is touched by the 
air, it is affected by the energies of the universe. Because of this, 
Pleiadian mothers do their best to let the new person be born when they 
are ready. The feeling is that the person coming in is on a path of 
discovery and learning, and they will pick the moment they want to be 
born in order to line up with the energies that will help them. It's quite 
possible this is all taken into consideration by Creation when the move is 
made into the womb. 

Now that we are born and have returned to the material world, we have a 
new material consciousness with which to experience life. Our 
subconscious is empty except for the memories of growth in the womb 
and birth, and our psyche is healthy and clean, with no emotions or 
feelings of hate, anger, prejudice, or anxiety. We have been at one with 
Creation for some time and have just left a wonderful, restful period. All 


we have to do now is learn how to think logically and correctly, so we can 
live to our fullest potential through a long and happy life filled with love. 

 

Learning Meditation 

 

I was raised in the Episcopal Church in the Midwestern town of Wichita, 
Kansas and was considered a Christian, just like everyone else there. It 
wasn't until I began to travel the world many years after leaving home that 
I became aware of the many different belief structures and concepts of life 
that exist on Earth. 

The concept of meditation was one new idea that I learned to embrace. It 
has taken on a growing importance in my life. I had meditated before, but 
what I was learning from Billy was all new to me and took some real 
brainwork for me to understand. The concepts of meditation/concentration 
prove useful in developing personal control and, most importantly, are a 
means to access the spiritual power in all of us. I had never been exposed 
to meditation when I was younger. I was only taught prayer at the church. 
A whole new world opened up to me when I discovered what can be 
learned and accomplished through meditation. 

At the Center Billy has built a meditation room that all of the members of 
the F.I.G.U. use. They have a regular schedule, which they keep on the 
kitchen wall, so that they can keep track of the time spent in the 
meditation room each week. Since all of the members were learning and 
studying spiritual growth themselves, the meditation room was a very busy 
place. 

 


What is Meditation 

Meditation is mostly associated with Eastern philosophy, since it is 
practiced so widely there. But it should be made clear that meditation is a 
form of concentration which leads to control of the mind, and it can be 
practiced by anyone. It is not necessary to adhere to any mystical 
philosophy, belief system, or religion to use meditation for your own 
benefit. Even though its popularity lies in the East, it is rapidly gaining in 
use in Western society; increasingly, more people discover the benefits of 
being able to communicate with the many different levels of consciousness 
through meditation. It is a method by which we can gain control over our 
thought processes, develop spiritually, or come in communication with 
higher life forms such as the Pleiadians. 

When we come into a new life, our material consciousness is formed along 
with our body. Our senses of sight, touch, smell, taste, and hearing tire 
developed for information gathering, and we begin to form new thoughts. 
At this point our new material subconscious only has the memories of birth, 
and our psyche is almost devoid of any feelings, emotions, and attitudes. 
Material emotions and memories are created and collected during the life; 
they do not exist when we arrive. All that comes with us are the memories 
and feelings of the spirit. Our thought processes are very simple, for we 
have no material memories or psychic feelings to create them. It is here 
that we have the opportunity to learn to think properly so that our life can 
be lived and experienced to its greatest joy. 

 

Most of the worries of the world are caused by illogical thinking. 

At the time the spirit enters the body and the new life begins, we are 
healthy in body and spirit. The spirit cannot be illogical or sick; this is 


strictly a function of the material self. As the body is being formed, its 
potential can be degenerated during the pregnancy by drugs, alcohol, 
mental illness, and illogical thinking on the part of the mother. The new 
material life will already be damaged and cannot live to the fullest ability of 
the accumulated knowledge gained by the spirit. This can limit intelligence 
and aptitude and cause birth defects, which will impair the ability to think 
correctly. 

If the mother would use meditation during the pregnancy, she could not 
only communicate with the incoming person, but could control her own 
thinking and provide for a healthier birth. By controlling our thinking, we 
control both our physical and mental health, thus providing a good 
beginning for the new life. 

By learning meditation, you develop what is called the meditation 
concentration. This is nothing more than developing the ability to 
concentrate on a particular object and see it clearly, untainted by feelings, 
attitudes, memories, and negative and positive thinking, while not allowing 
any other thoughts to enter your mind. Once this is accomplished, you are 
in control of your thinking and on the road to developing powerful spiritual 
abilities as well. There are many ways that meditation can be helpful in 
your life. 

 

The Conscious Thinking 

Most of our entire life is spent in conscious thinking. It is the process of 
forming a thought from our memories and feelings, which allows us to 
communicate with ourselves and each other. If we could not think, we 
could not learn or grow, and would be no different from the animals with 
which we share the Earth. Thought allows us to understand our 


experiences and gain in wisdom, which leads to spiritual growth. Without 
thought, we could not function as living beings. 

Even though thought is so important to us, there is very little training on 
how to perform it. In school we are told what to think, but not how to do 
it. There is no education on how to think or how to control the thinking 
processes. Through meditation we will learn to not only understand what 
thought is, but how to control it for our benefit. 

First, there is the conscious mind; its energy affects the electrical 
body which charges the chemicals that feed the cells. 

 

Negative and Positive Thinking 

As we create the energy of thought, we give these energies a negative, 
positive, or neutral charge due to our own way of thinking, feeling, and 
according to our own behavior patterns. Meditation can serve as a means 
for achieving harmony between the positive and negative and create a 
state of balance, or neutral thinking. You will also learn to know yourself 
better and exercise more control over yourself. 

 

The Spiritual Powers 

Through meditation/concentration you can learn to bring forth the 
spiritual powers of telepathy, telekinesis, and time travel. These abilities 
are inherent in the spirit and can be made accessible to the material self 
through meditation, if you are willing to put in the time and effort. 

Telepathy is the ability for humans to send and receive thoughts using the 
we-form sense that is in all of us. The material self and the spiritual self 
both have dissimilar we-forms which operate differently. Both can be 


accessed through meditation and can be developed to be useful attributes 
in our life. 

You can also learn telekinesis, a method of moving objects without 
touching them physically, again through the use of pure spiritual powers. 
For most people this ability may take years of practice in order to develop 
the necessary concentration. If practiced every day, the average person 
may find some success in about seven years. 

Meditation can enable you to transfer yourself mentally/visually into the 
past or future and gain information on various events. These events may 
be in the past or may be projections of a future that has not yet happened. 

The ability to develop and use any of your natural spiritual powers lies in 
the development of meditation as the tool or mechanism by which you gain 
access to these abilities. All communications of the mind and spirit are 
made possible through meditation. You will find it necessary to put in a 
great deal of time and energy into this practice of 
meditation/concentration, in the material realm as well as in the spiritual 
realm, if you expect to achieve any kind of results. 

 

The Concentration 

Meditation allows you to see something clearly, observe it clearly and 
recognize it clearly, without entertaining a thought. First we produce the 
desire or will to create a meditative concentration, to grasp something or 
to put something into practice. Then the desire or will must be completely 
disregarded and put aside so that the concentration can be obtained. This 
means that in order to obtain a pure, meditative concentration—a 
reflection in the purest form, a clarity of vision of whatever it happens to 
be—the will must not be carried into the meditation. When you are ready 


to meditate, you do not say, "Now, I will concentrate," or "Now, I will 
meditate," or "Now, I will do this or that." These are the thoughts that form 
your will to perform meditation and must be set aside, or you will not be 
able to concentrate in any form. 

By developing meditation, we learn to direct our senses toward something 
quite definite, and then we concentrate on it. During this concentration, no 
other thoughts may be entertained because the concentration may consist 
only of absolute clarity of vision, or clarity of reflection. This means we 
must observe the object of our concentration while being completely void 
of any outside thoughts. 

Meditation, then, is going to allow us to control our day-to-day thinking 
and give us access to the powers of our higher spiritual self. Consequently, 
meditation means this: Learning balance, learning clarity of vision and 
clarity of reflection, acquiring the ability to transmit spiritual consciousness 
into the spheres of the past and the future, and acquisition of spiritual 
capabilities such as telepathy, telekinesis, etc. Next, let's discuss the need 
for meditation, and then, how to perform meditation and what it can do for 
us. 

 

The Need for Meditation 

When we first come into life, our thoughts are very simple. Our conscious 
mind is functioning well, and all of our senses are working and are trying to 
interpret the new world we are in. We can see around us, but don't know 
what we are looking at. We can hear sounds, but have no idea what they 
are. Touching things is a new discovery, and even the food we eat doesn't 
seem familiar.

The reason everything is so new and unfamiliar is that the material 
subconscious has very little information in it. We have very few memories 
yet, and at this point we have no data in our subconscious to flash us those 
SYMPATHY or ANTIPATHY feelings that are used to form thoughts. 

Remember, our conscious mind creates thoughts by flashing to the 
subconscious, checking for any available data that we have on the object of 


which we are forming the thought. Since the subconscious is where we 
keep our memories and has nothing to flash back yet, our thoughts are 
very simple indeed. 

The subconscious deals in visions, not words, and portrays its 
message in dreams. 

As we continue to experience the world around us, we begin to build up 
memories in our subconscious from experience. These are new memories 
about our mother, our crib, the food we are fed, and the many new sounds 
we hear. Very slowly we begin to create feelings of happiness as we are fed 
and taken care of. And, of course, there is the love we feel for our parents. 
These feelings start to form the emotions that build up in our psyche, 
which will also become part of our new thoughts. 

The process of thinking is instinctive, so we don't have to figure it out. The 
flashing between our conscious and our subconscious is built-in and is 
ready to operate; it only needs data to start building more complex 
thoughts. 

As we get older and continue to experience the world around us, our 
thoughts will increase in complexity. We came into the world happy and full 
of love, but as we get older and come in contact with a more hostile and 
unfriendly world, we start to form new emotions to protect ourselves. If we 
let this process go unchecked, eventually we fill our psyche with feelings of 
anxiety, fear, hostility, anger, and depression in order to respond to this 
new environment. These psychic feelings then become part of our thoughts 
and how we express ourselves. No one comes into the world angry or 
prejudiced and yelling at those around them. These are acquired responses 
as a result of life's experiences. 

Through meditation we can learn to control incoming data so that when our 


psyche is forming, we can handle the fear, anger, and hostility that are 
directed towards us, so negative emotions do not form. As we are 
confronted with negative elements in society, we can learn to pause during 
the flashing process that forms our thoughts and use our spiritual self to 
keep in balance. When we are young, most of us are overwhelmed with 
childhood experiences that leave very deep emotional scars which affect 
our thinking as we get older. As we reach maturity, we recognize that we 
are not in control of our thoughts and go searching for ways to rid 
ourselves of depression, anger, anxiety, and other negative feelings that 
rule our lives. We turn to self-help courses of different types, which make 
an effort to help us overcome our inner feelings and live a more balanced 
life. It would have been better if we had been taught how to think, using 
meditation when we were young; then, we would not have formed these 
negative feelings in the first place. Meditation provides us with the inner 
strength to deal with any situation and remain in a calm and balanced 
state. 

Since meditation gives us access to communication between the any areas 
of the mind, it should be taught to everyone when they are young. After 
all, thinking controls our life, so why not learn to do it better? If we have 
already reached adulthood, we can still learn to meditate and repair the 
damage that has been done. Once we learn to control our thinking and 
bring our spiritual selves into action, our lives become easier and more 
productive. 

 

How to Perform a Simple Meditation 

Before getting any more detailed about what is possible through 
meditation, let's go through the steps of a simple meditation/concentration 


so that we better understand the process and see what is possible. 

There are many methods of inducing meditation, ranging from focusing on 
a candle flame or concentrating on a crystal. You may use any method that 
suits you, but I prefer to develop the meditative/concentration using 
breathing, since our respiration connects us directly to our life energy and 
gives us a sense of well-being. 

For best results this should be done in a sitting position, preferably in the 
lotus position with legs crossed. This type of sitting position should not be 
seen as the only method, especially in the Western world, as the lotus 
position can be very difficult due to lack of practice. You must use a 
position that is comfortable so that your attention is not drawn to any 
bodily discomfort, which will distract you during the meditation. For myself, 
I use a soft cushion to sit on, since my legs do not fold very well. 

You do not want to be influenced by outside energies or sound, so try o 
find a location that is both comfortable and quiet. If you have room in your 
home, you may want to build a special meditation area where you are 
comfortable and not bothered by the outside world. Here you can cleanse 
your surroundings of negative energies and create an environment where 
you feel comfortable and relaxed. 

It is also important that you free yourself of all worldly objects like 
watches, rings, necklaces, earrings, or any other jewelry you may normally 
wear that affects your personality or thoughts. It is also suggested that no 
clothing whatsoever be worn, but that, of course, is up to you. The 
objective here is to put you in the most balanced state possible, so you can 
bring out the spiritual being that is connected to Creation, and leave the 
material being and all of its feelings, emotions, and personality behind 
during the concentration. 


 

The Relaxation 

Once we are in a comfortable position, we are ready to relax ourselves. 
The thinking of the day stores its energy in all of the cells of our body. So 
we are more affected than others. We can release this build-up of tension 
by taking three deep breaths and releasing them slowly. Deep breathing is 
very good at releasing energy and bringing the body back to a more 
relaxed state. 

 

The Breathing Exercise 

The breathing exercise is used to familiarize us with the concept of 
concentration, so we can learn to control our thinking. The objective here is to 
observe the natural flow of our respiration, while not influencing it in any 
way. Do not hold your breath or intentionally subject it to any artificial 
rhythm. The object here is to follow the breathing procedure calmly and 
carefully during the exercise. 

Close your eyes and focus your attention on the sides of your nostrils, and 
begin to observe your breath as it moves in and out of your nasal passage. 
Try to keep in a state of observation and do not become involved in the 
rhythm of your breath. If you catch yourself affecting the flow of your 
breath, causing it to speed up or slow down, just relax and become the 
observer, not the controller. You will probably make an effort to control 
your breath and may cause it to go even more out of control. Simply relax 
and let your breath find its own pace, and remember, you have been 
breathing for years without any help from your conscious mind. Simply 
become the observer and make no attempt to regulate the flow of your 
breath. Observation means that you are not influencing the breath in any 


Way with any of your material senses or thoughts; you are only observing 
it. 

Observe your breath as it flows up the side of your nostrils and disappears 
at the top of your nose. DO NOT FOLLOW IT. This would take your 
attention away from your observation spot. 

The inhaling and exhaling usually becomes noticeable as a cool stream of 
air that keeps moving. Even if your observation is strictly concentrate on 
the fixed point of the sides of the nose (nostrils), a peripheral awareness of 
the course of the breath through the body is produced, arising from the 
slight pressure of the air we breathe. No further consideration should be 
given t it. 

As your concentration continues, you will begin to notice exactly w ere the 
breath enters the nostrils, where it starts to flow up the sides of the 
nostrils, and where it disappears. These three spots mark the beginning, 
middle, and end of the breath, and they become clearer and clearer as the 
concentration continues. 

 

Awareness of Your Body 

If you become very uncomfortable during this exercise, you will not be able 
to continue and may have to start over. However, if you only become 
aware of your body, you should simply treat this awareness as an 
observation which has disturbed the tranquil harmony of the concentration. 
Simply visualize that the respiration EXISTS, completely independent of 
the intention of the meditation exercise, and discard the awareness of 
your body. 

 


Unwanted Thoughts 

As you continue to observe your breath, it is only natural that unwanted 
thoughts come into your mind. Since we are not trained in controlling our thinking, 
our mind is used to racing from one thought to another anytime it wishes. 
By developing concentration, the ability to focus on only one object at a 
time, we are serving notice to our material consciousness that we are 
taking charge of our thinking. This will be something new for most of us, 
and it will require some time to become successful. 

As unwanted thoughts jump into your mind, you must order them to 
disappear and return to your observation mode. It is a good idea before 
starting this exercise to tell your conscious self that you intend to 
concentrate now, and not to bother you with any thoughts. Tell yourself to 
hold all thoughts until you are through with your meditation, and that you 
will instruct it when you are ready to continue normal thinking. 

If you can concentrate for one minute without another thought 
coming into your mind, you will have dramatically changed your 
life. 

Our mind is used to manufacturing ideas and images for us all of the time, 
conforming to the internal wish list provided by our ego and other 
emotions. If we do not take control of our thinking, our mind will continue 
to make up all sorts of images while we are trying to concentrate. Learning 
to concentrate will help us begin to take control of our thinking processes, 
but we must be careful to be honest with ourselves and not allow our ego 
to manufacture unwanted thoughts and images. 

 

Continued Observation 

Continue your observation until a deep feeling of well-being and relaxation 


is obtained. Allow yourself some time to benefit from the enjoyable state of 
mind. Relish the moment and become familiar with the location in your 
mind that has produced this moment, for you will want to return here 
often. 

The most important objective during this exercise is to learn to concentrate 
on any one object for a period of time and keep out unwanted thoughts. 
Just this simple exercise can begin to restore power to your thinking. By 
developing the power to concentrate on a single object in meditation, you 
are learning how to control your thinking, and you can apply this to normal 
life by being more productive and less influenced by she outside 
environment. 

Continue this exercise daily until you can concentrate on a single object 
without any unwanted thoughts for one minute. This may not seem like 
much, but most people will find it harder than they expect it to be. 

 

Summary of Exercise 

This is a very simple exercise that you can practice any time of day, 
wherever you are. It's very good to use in a tense or stressful situation to 
help calm yourself down. I would suggest that you practice the exercise 
every day before you have lunch. This will serve to compose you from the 
hectic thoughts of your workday, making your lunch more enjoyable. It 
also allows you to work the concepts of relaxation, concentration, and 
thought control into your everyday life. 

 

The Uses of Meditation 

Through continued use of meditation, we can learn to control our conscious 


mind by pausing during the flashing process of thought formation, and 
allowing our spiritual self to give us advice. We can also learn to program 
our subconscious to perform work for us while we sleep, for example, in 
order to lose weight or stop smoking. 

Emotions that are causing us problems in life can be reprogrammed by 
creating new experiences that come to happier conclusions. All levels of 
our mind can be controlled and addressed through meditation. It is this 
simple exercise that puts us on the road to controlling the communication 
of all levels of our mind. 

Turning off the force of your material thoughts allows the force of 
your spirit to come forward 

Meditation is also the first step towards controlling our material mind and 
letting the power of our spirit come forward. The ability to call forth our 
spiritual self and make use of our spiritual powers rests in the ability to 
turn off our material mind and allow our spiritual self to come through. Our 
spiritual self is always there, listening to all that we do, and never sleeps. 
Most of us never consider that we can call forward our spirit to offer an 
opinion, to give advice, or to teach us something about ourselves and our 
previous existences. And seldom does anyone ever consider using their 
spiritual self to contact other life forms. However, all of these things are 
possible through the continued development of meditation. 

 

Pausing 

As the Pleiadians listen to our thoughts and analyze how we think, it has 
become apparent to them that we need to learn some simple techniques of 
controlling our thinking that can be used in everyday life. One of these 
simple techniques is called the pause. 


Most of the problems in the world are not caused by disease or wars, but 
by our thoughts. How often have we spoken too quickly and said 
something that we regret, only to ruin a deal or a friendship. When we feel 
depressed or angry, it is our thoughts that control us. If we could learn to 
pause as our thoughts are being formed or as our emotions are taking 
control of us, we could be in control of how we feel. Training ourselves to 
pause before we speak, to consider just for that one quick moment what 
we are about to say, can save a lot of misery in the world. 

The pause can be exercised as our minds are flashing between the 
conscious and the subconscious and adding feelings from the psyche. As 
thoughts are formed very quickly, we must train ourselves to interact in 
this process by pausing, either as the thought is being formed or before we 
speak. 

As an example, let's say that your boss has just called you into his office 
about your work. You're in a great mood as you enter his office, and 
suddenly he begins to call you a boneheaded, good-for-nothing employee 
who had better shape up or look for another job. Your immediate reaction 
is to defend yourself, and you feel your body tighten up as you start to 
react. At this point you have many choices to make. You could allow his 
outburst to get you mad and yell back. This would probably get you fired 
and put you in a foul mood as well. A more controlled response would be 
to simply let him yell at you until he calms down, say nothing, and keep 
your job. You may also consider how to say something to calm him down 
and change his mind about you. There are many options. Just as you are 
about to speak, pause, and consider what you are about to do. Pause, and 
let your spiritual self come forward and make a suggestion. Pause, and 
calm your body with a deep breath before doing anything. If you allow 
yourself to pause, your spiritual self will send you ideas or hunches that are 


always of a more gentle and calm nature. Since the spirit cannot be sick, it 
does not contain any negative thoughts or feelings. It can be relied upon to 
guide you and give you advice from a more balanced position. How many 
times have you been trying to think of what to say and the first thing that 
popped into your mind was the right thing? That is your spiritual self trying 
to help out. Learn to acknowledge this first little hunch, and consider it 
more carefully before pushing on and ignoring it. 

The pause can very helpful in controlling your conscious mind and your 
state of balance. If you find yourself deeply depressed, you can pause, 
explain to yourself that you are allowing an emotion from your psyche to 
influence your state of mind, and replace the emotion with another image 
that makes you feel better. By doing this, you have changed how you feel 
just by pausing and taking part in the thought process. 

It is our thinking, more than anything else that keeps the Pleiadians from 
wanting to have open contact with us. Our thoughts are too often plagued 
with misery, negativity, or feelings that are very uncomfortable for them 
to be around. It will not be possible for Earth to have open commerce 
with the planets of the Pleiades until we learn to think in a more 
controlled manner. 

 

The Meditative Immersion Using Colors 

While the breathing exercise is good and helps you relax and build 
concentration, you will want to develop beyond this into a deep 
meditation, where more things are possible. To achieve this, you can use 
a method other than turning your observation toward your breath in your 
nostrils. This method of immersion is now directed toward the eyes in 
such a way as to concentrate on colors which will appear as the 


immersion into meditation progresses. There are many methods using 
colors as a guideline to the depth of immersion into meditation. The 
members of the F.I.G.U. in Switzerland use the following colors, as do 
many other people. 

You begin the meditation/concentration with a matter-of-fact attitude. 
This means that your knowledge of the existence of the colors is present, 
but you do not think about them directly. It is enough to know that they 
exist without having to manufacture them first, so they can very simply 
be observed. As the meditative immersion continues, the colors will 
systematically come to your eyes as the depth of the immersion 
continues. The purpose of the colors is to help you understand the depth 
of your meditative immersion and the possibilities that you are capable of 
at any level of immersion. 

(The standard colors of meditative immersion used by most people are: 
Blue, Green, Yellow, and Red.) 

BLUE Represents the color of the presence, the life force, and your 
existence. This will be the first color to present itself and lets you know 
the immersion has begun. Once the color blue begins to appear, allow to 
it to occur three times; this will let you know it is time to concentrate on 
your secondary goal determination, the view into the past or future. 

GREEN As the immersion continues and becomes deeper into the spirit, 
the color green will appear. This represents to you that you are changing 
from conscious thinking to the subconscious. It can also mean that you 
are beginning to move in time, either from the present to the past, or 
the future. Allow the color green to also occur three times, followed by 
a deep, inward concentration. 

YELLOW represents the color of the concluded change from the 


conscious to the unconscious, as well as the concluded change from 
the present to the past or future. Depending on the individual, it may 
to take several months or years to reach this level, for it requires very 
good concentration skills. Allow the presence of yellow to occur three 
times, with a deep concentration to follow. 

RED represents the color of penetration into the unconscious, or 
penetration into the past or future. I t is also the signal that the 
meditative immersion has been attained and now the spiritual 
subconscious starts to work on its own in reference to the secondary 
goal determination, which in this case would be time travel into the 
future or the past. 

Before starting this meditation, concentrate your thoughts on what you 
want to accomplish in your meditation. Your first goal is to create t e 
meditative immersion. Your second goal might be to move in time to see 
the past or future. The secondary goal must be decided before starting 
the meditation. Once you have your goals in mind, follow these steps: 

Get into a comfortable position, either sitting or lying down, and 
loosen up the entire body. 

Close your eyes and deeply breathe in and out three times. 

With your eyes closed, direct your attention to the back of your 
eyelids and observe the light. Continue the concentration until the 
color blue presents itself. 

Once the immersion is complete and a good concentration is obtained, 
the color red will slowly vanish and become a veil of mist, causing the 
occurrence of vague and, at first, incoherent forms of dream images in 
the waking state that have not been created by you. They must 
appear without being called or created by you. 


These waking-state, dreamlike images can be distinguished from the 
normal daydream by their extreme clarity and distinct qualities. They 
remain extremely constant and do not fade away or disappear like sleeping 
images do, but remain very vivid. If you are performing the meditation 
correctly, he images will not display any power of suggestion or try to 
influence you as a sleeping dream might. At first they will seem hard to 
understand, but will gradually become logical and understandable, and 
hopefully begin to make sense. These images always display events in their 
natural order, instead of jumping around like normal dreams. 

In most cases, these images are hard to understand and will take many 
hours of time to understand them. This is done after your return from the 
meditation immersion. The spirit will send impulses from the subconscious 
to help bring the image to a conclusion. Our normal world makes this very 
difficult, for there are billions of people thinking on the planet, making it 
almost impossible to meditate to any great depth or investigate new 
images. If you are serious and wish to continue your meditation beyond 
this level, it will be necessary to construct a pyramid capable of shielding 
your mind from the thoughts of the world and all outside influences. If you 
wish- to build a personal pyramid, make it about six feet high and use the 
same relative specifications as the Great Pyramid in Egypt. 

Another extremely important factor when producing waking-state dreams 
is that you must be totally honest with yourself at this stage, and not 
create these images from your ego. Any thoughts you may have that 
create these images will be from your own material self and are usually 
caused directly by your own emotional problems, such as wanting to be 
popular or revered by others as a great medium, etc. Do not proceed any 
farther unless you can be honest with yourself. You are in no danger if you 
allow the images to come from your spiritual self. 


 

Return from the Meditative Immersion 

Returning from the meditative immersion is very simple and requires 
nothing more than a simple thought to initiate the return to the material 
consciousness. You do not need to be concerned about not being able to 
return from the immersion; there is never any danger of that. 

To return, you simply reverse the process of colors that have been used. If 
you have used the colors of BLUE, GREEN, YELLOW, and RED as the 
meditative immersion colors, they will also be used as the colors to return 
with. Always use the same colors in reverse mode so that your mind 
understands what you are doing. 

Simply envision the color RED first; it is only necessary to cause the color 
to occur once at each level. Then replace the color with YELLOW, then with 
GREEN, and then with BLUE. As you envision the colors, it serves as a 
signal to your mind that you are returning, and you will gradually come out 
of your immersion and return to the normal, thinking and conscious state. 

Once the color BLUE appears, your material consciousness is automatically 
restored, and you will begin to think in a normal fashion. All of your 
senses—hearing, seeing, touching, smell, and taste—will immediately 
become aware of your environment as you return to the present physical 
life. It's not uncommon to take a few minutes to become fully oriented, and 
it is normal to feel a little sleepy, like you are floating on air. 

 

Summary of the Meditation Immersion 

The meditation immersion is a very powerful tool that allows the individual 
full access to control over his thinking, as well as to the powers of the 


spiritual realm. The method described here is a simple guideline for the 
individual to follow and experiment with on his own. 

It can take years to obtain the ability to use the spiritual powers of 
telepathy, telekinesis, or time travel. The time will vary from person to 
person, but you can expect to invest many hours in order to see good 
results. The degree of results depends on the ability to concentrate and 
develop clarity of vision that allows you to see objects as they really are. 
Combining the meditation practice with modern techniques using sound 
waves can dramatically improve your results. 

Further explanations of certain meditative techniques should be mentioned 
here to help with your progress and quality of results. Read those ideas 
carefully and monitor your progress with honesty in order to develop good 
habits of meditation. 

 

The Power of Observation 

The ability to observe objects and see them as they really are is very 
important in meditation. Objects may be people, thoughts, ideas, visions, 
or whatever the object of the meditation is. In our normal thinking, we see 
these objects with our material senses and transfer that image to our 
subconscious where we receive impulses related to it. After flashing on our 
memories, attitudes, feelings, and emotions, we may no longer be sensing 
the object as it really is, but as we perceive it to be. 

A typical example may be viewing a beautiful sunset at the beach. When 
the sunset is first observed by our vision, it will flash through our 
consciousness, and we will immediately feel the impact of all of the stored-
up memories and feelings that we have about sunsets. Within an instant 
thousands of memories about the sun, water, sky, and other wonderful 


moments come together and we get a nice, warm feeling about the sunset. 
After all, who doesn't enjoy watching a beautiful sunset over the ocean? 

Because we have so many stored-up memories and feelings about sunsets, 
we overlook seeing the details that are really there. Instead the object, the 
sunset, is taken as a whole, and we rely on our stored-up memories to 
form the observation. This is common throughout life as we call upon our 
memories and feelings to observe things around us. 

In meditation we want to set aside all preconceived memories, feelings, 
and emotions and observe things from the very beginning as they really 
are. We want to purely observe the object as a receiver, without 
influencing the object through our own form of will and without exerting 
any influence or evaluation on the object. If we are going to meditate on a 
sunset, we want to set aside all of our memories, feelings, and 
preconceived notions of what a sunset is and discover it all over again by 
purely observing it in the meditation. 

This would be accomplished by entering the meditation/concentration and 
not allowing any unwanted thoughts or preconceived ideas of what a 
sunset is to enter our minds. We would concentrate on the image of the 
sunset and observe it, just as we observed our breath in the breathing 
exercise. We fix our observation on the sunset and become the observer. 
As our concentration continues, we will begin to receive impulses from the 
sunset. Very slowly the sunset will present itself to us. First, we will 
become aware of the color of the sun; then, its shape. Very slowly our 
observation of the sunset will continue to fill in the smallest and most 
minute details of all that we are concentrating on. We will become aware of 
all of the colors around the sun, the water below, and the sky around it. As 
our concentration continues, our spirit will add the feelings of Creation, and 
the sunset ill take on a completely new meaning to us. Acting as a 


receiver, we will have allowed the sunset to present itself, or "speak" to us, 
causing a sensation of spiritual bonding and love that we never thought 
possible. Complete relaxation and feeling a harmony with nature and 
Creation will flow into our meditation. By letting go of our normal thinking 
processes, we will have allowed the power of our spirit to come through. 

 

Clarity of Vision and Reflection 

Once our abilities of concentration and pure observation lead us into 
meaningful meditation, we will begin to receive visions and images from 
different times. When we return from the immersion and begin to reflect on 
what we have seen and encountered, it is important that we do not allow 
our material memories and emotions to distort or taint what we have seen. 

Just as clarity of observation is important in building a truthful 
concentration, we must also be able to reflect clearly on what we have 
seen. It is important to remain in a balanced and neutral state of mind 
while we reflect on what we have seen so that we can learn from it. 

 

Time Goes by Quickly 

When you are meditating, time can pass by very quickly. It is not 
uncommon to discover that 15 or even 30 minutes in meditation can see 
like just a couple of minutes. Because of this, it is a good idea to have 
someone watch the clock, so you can be brought out of the meditation at a 
definite time. The reason for this is that once you are in a deep 
meditation/concentration, you lose control of time and have no idea how 
long you have been there. Your spirit is connected to the timeless and is 
not used to a watch or timepiece. It is only your material senses that have 
a sense of time. If you are meditating alone, you might want to set a clock 


radio or music player of some type to start playing after 30 minutes. This 
should be very quiet so as to not shock you. Don't worry if you are 
meditating in bed before falling asleep because the meditation will find its 
end after you fall asleep. 

 

Neutral Thinking 

In your normal, daily thinking process you should learn to think neutrally. I 
call this being in balance. The idea of neutral thinking is to develop a 
discipline of thinking that prevents us from having negative or positive 
thoughts in any form. This is accomplished in part by the pause, which 
intervenes during the flashing as our thoughts are made. As we become 
more in control of our thinking, it is much easier to keep out unwanted 
negative and positive thoughts that throw us out of balance. Of course, in 
normal life we all have thoughts that are varying degrees of negative and 
positive. It's just part of our normal learning process. Developing the 
concept of neutral thinking gives us control over our thinking and allows us 
to be more neutral, or balanced, when we need to be. This process also 
gives us more control over our negative and positive thoughts, so they do 
not have as much control over us. 

It is also desirable to keep negative and positive thoughts out of our 
concentration and only allow purely neutral thoughts to be applied. It is our 
negative thinking that makes open, public contact with the Pleiadians 
impossible. We have over five billion people on Earth who are thinking with 
no control. They are creating energies uncomfortable to the Pleiadians and 
harmful to ourselves and nature. If we could teach the whole world to think 
in a more balanced way and to keep out the more exaggerated negative 
and positive thoughts, most of our differences would vanish overnight. 


 

The Boomerang 

One of the problems in dealing with our own thoughts is that it is 
sometimes hard to discover what constitutes a negative or positive 
thought. We are not used to analyzing our thinking and saying, "Oops, 
there goes a negative thought," or "Now I'm thinking positively." Most of 
us are not even aware of our thinking and haven't given much thought to 
what kinds of thoughts we are creating. We are comfortable that our 
thoughts are not heard by anyone else, so we don't have to be concerned 
about what we think. Besides, who is to decide if a thought is negative or 
positive? 

If we wanted to analyze our thoughts in order to clean up our thinking and 
learn something about ourselves, there is a logical way we can monitor our 
thoughts and see if they are positive or negative, and know what kind of 
effect they are having on the universe. It's called the boomerang. When a 
thought is created inside of your head, it does not stay there. Even though 
we are not consciously aware of it, our thoughts leave our physical body 
and go out into the universe. Thoughts are much faster than the speed of 
light and can penetrate deep into the cosmos instantly. Your thinking 
blends in with billions of other thoughts and takes its part in the scheme of 
things. Most importantly, just like a boomerang, our thoughts reach a 
certain distance and then turn around and come back to us. The 
boomerang effect is the process of sending back the thought you sent out, 
but in a slightly changed form. 

There are two parts to a thought. There is the thought itself, and then 
there is the energy that hurls the thought out into the universe. When your 
thought speeds out into the universe, it will eventually come to the end of 


its travels, and like a boomerang, it will turn around and head back to 
where it came from. Another interesting part of this process is that the 
thought will become polarized by the energy of the universe and return in a 
slightly different form. The thought itself will not change and will return in 
the some form as when it left, but the energy that hurled it out into the 
cosmos will return it in the opposite polarity to when it left. If we pay 
attention to this process, we will be able to learn for ourselves the effect 
our thoughts are really having. You see, we may think we are thinking very 
positively, but perhaps we are not. Ego can get in the way and distort our 
thinking. By using the process of the boomerang as a means of analyzing 
our thinking we can really learn what is going on in our minds. This, of 
course, requires a certain honesty with ourselves, as we might not always 
like the result. Let's see how this works. 

Even though it is of importance to us, the actual thought itself is of little 
relevance to the universe. It is the charge of the hurling energy that has an 
effect throughout the universe. If you are thinking about your relationship 
and how much you care about this person, the thought is very important to 
you, and you would probably consider it a positive thought. Let's say the 
thought is about how anxiously you are looking forward to seeing your 
lover on Saturday night. You're dwelling on this idea and envisioning going 
to dinner and spending time with each other. To you, this is a very positive 
and happy thought. 

As you think these thoughts, they speed out into the cosmos. Your vision 
of having dinner together, the thought you created, is intact. As you create 
this thought in your mind, a small form of energy that will hurl this idea 
out into the universe is also formed. This hurling energy has an electrical 
charge created by you. It may be negative or positive, depending on the 
meaning of your thinking. 


 boomerang.jpg


As the thought reaches the end of its travels out into the cosmos, it slows 
down and begins to depolarize. The thought of having dinner stays the 
same, but the hurling energy depolarizes and switches poles. If the hurling 
energy had been negative, it would now be positive and vice versa. The 
thought and its hurling energy now are speeding back towards you. The 
thought is still the same, but the hurling energy is now in its opposite form. 

The distance the thought has traveled is dependent on the power of your 
thought and the force of your spirit. It may return to you quickly within a 
few minutes, or sometimes it may take up to three days to return. 
Consider also that you may continue thinking this thought for some time 
and send it out millions of times, each one returning at different times. The 


power of the returning hurling energy is equal to the power of the sending 
hurling energy. If you have sent out a thought that was hurled by very 
large amounts of negative energy, you will receive one back with very 
large amounts of positive energy. 

As the thought returns, your mind acts as a radio receiver and picks it up. 
It has returned and entered your mind for consideration. This is an 
automatic process that happens continually in your mind. This forces you 
to once again think the same thought, but it has returned encompassed 
with a hurling energy of different force. What left your mind as a positive 
and happy thought will return with a negative charge, causing you to think 
the same thought of having dinner with your lover, but you will feel the 
effects of the negative hurling energy that came with it. Your mind will 
immediately consider the upcoming event of having dinner with a slightly 
different viewpoint this time and send the thought out again. This happens 
millions of times, causing us to consider something from many different 
views. Our spiritual selves watch this process and are not affected by it, 
but our material minds can become confused, angry, depressed, happy, 
sad, or can even cause sickness in the body as a result. 

If we send out thoughts intentionally and watch for their return, we can 
learn how we are really thinking, and work out the answers to our 
problems. For instance, we may have ulterior motives for having dinner 
with someone and not be consciously aware of it. The boomerang effect 
will draw our attention to the true meaning of our thinking and make us 
face up to the idea of what we are really up to. Even though others don't 
hear our thoughts, we must face up to them ourselves. You cannot lie to 
yourself or fool your spirit. In the end, you must learn to be honest with 
yourself. If you do not, you will make yourself sick. 

The boomerang process will help us learn more about ourselves. We are 


working toward a time of development where the strength of the positive 
and the negative are equal. This is balance. Once you can form a thought 
from a completely balanced viewpoint, it will return the same way. A 
balanced thought is one that does not contain a negative or positive hurling 
charge; it is neutral and returns the same as when it left. The feeling of a 
returning thought that is in balance can be felt by your spirit, just as a 
negative or positive one can. You will be able to feel it and learn to 
recognize the neutral polarity. There is a feeling of contentment that comes 
over you when you know you are thinking logically. It is a form of spiritual 
bonding that lets you know that you are in alignment with the universe. 

We must have positive and negative thoughts in order to learn and grow. It 
is a natural process of growth. If we only created positive thoughts, we 
could not develop. The boomerang is a way of monitoring ourselves and 
learning to face the truth about our thinking. Here we discover that our 
material thoughts are filled with many devious spikes put there by inflated 
egos and emotional problems. Just the stress of living in our everyday 
world pushes us to defend ourselves with rather creative thinking. Our 
spirits cannot become sick or create illogical thoughts and are not affected 
by ego and emotions. Learning to think in a more balanced way through 
the use of our spirits is the path to higher consciousness. Using the 
boomerang and being honest and open with ourselves is a sign of clear 
thinking, intelligence, and growth. 


The Echo Effect 

While the boomerang effect is most useful for an individual to learn about 
himself, another interesting phenomenon occurs when groups of people all 
send out the same thought together. In a boomerang, the hurling energy is 
depolarized by the universe and returned to the sender, forcing another 


consideration to the thought. If a group of people all send out the same 
thought at the same time, it forms a large block of energy at the location 
of the thought it was projected toward, and it echoes back to the group 
without being depolarized. Here is a better example. 

Suppose you get together with 1,000 other people at a rally to support 
world peace. The speaker is doing a wonderful job of creating a vision of 
harmony and love for the world, and everyone is feeling a beautiful 
uplifting of spirit. He then asks everyone to concentrate and send out a 
thought of unconditional love directed at a young child who is lying stricken 
with illness at a nearby hospital. A large picture of the child is brought out 
on stage and positioned so that everyone can see it. 


 echo effiect.jpg


Within a few minutes the energy from all of those thoughts converges on 
the photo. The combined thoughts of unconditional love begin to have an 
immediate effect on the nearby child. His stricken body starts to benefit 
from the great power of love, and this gives him more strength to battle 
his illness. 

The incredible concentration of similar energy that has been focused on 
one spot forms a block of balanced and loving energy. Within an instant 
there is an echo effect as the block reflects the energy from the people and 
sends it right back to them. The hurling energy has not gone out into the 
universe and been depolarized, so it will be returned to the senders just as 


it was sent. Since 1,000 people were able to send out beautiful thoughts of 
balanced energy, they will feel the echo effect of the same energy come 
ever them. This will magnify the beauty of the moment as the feeling of 
unconditional love is increased from the echo. This is a common effect with 
large crowds that are led into thinking the same thing at the same time. If 
people are caught up in a large crowd that is thinking happy and beautiful 
thoughts, then those happy thoughts will increase and magnify even 
greater. Likewise, this also has the same effect on large crowds that are 
taught to hate or are being led in anger. 

For instance, let's consider millions of people in a small country who are 
being led by a religious leader who hates America. If he can get them all to 
think the same thought of hatred and anger towards America at the same 
time, two things will happen. One, the thought of hate will be formed in 
America and have an uncomfortable effect on the people there. Two, the 
thought of hate will echo back to the millions who are projecting it and 
cause an even greater intensity of hate to occur. This is how radical leaders 
whip their followers into shape and exercise control over them. Do not 
think for a moment that many of these leaders are not aware of this 
technique; they use it to their advantage over an ignorant populace. 

The ability of large groups to create great amounts of energy through 
focusing their mental energy on the same thought will be the key to world 
control shifting to those of higher consciousness in the future. While 
negative power leaders are adept at controlling crowds and creating hate 
and anger which destabilizes the world, more positive spiritual leaders, 
who also understand this technique, can use it to create tremendous 
energies of unconditional love and balanced thinking to provide comfort to 
those who need it. 



Our Health Is Controlled by Our Thinking 

The Pleiadians tell us most of our illnesses are caused by our thinking. This 
is very true, since the energy formed by our thinking finds its way into 
every cell in our body. As the mind forms a thought, the polarity of the 
energy—whether negative, positive, or neutral—flows through our bodies 
and rests in our cells. The constant build-up of negative energy brought on 
by our thinking leads to the degeneration of the cell and eventually to 
disease. Sickness at this level is nothing more than energy in cells that is 
not polarized as it should be. To keep ourselves healthy, it is important to 
keep our cells healthy. 

Since our thoughts can play such an important role in our health, it can 
also lead to affecting our life span. Many Eastern philosophers believe it s 
good to slow down the beats of the heart to increase life. It is most 
important to think with balanced, neutral thinking and to keep our minds 
active by challenging them with creative thought. 

Too much sickness on Earth is caused by illogical thinking. 

 

Use Meditation to Control Problems Such As Smoking, Eating, et . 

We can use the techniques of meditation to overcome simple problems, 
such as smoking or overeating. These troublesome habits become 
reinforced due to laziness, illogical thinking, pleasure, pain, fear, and any 
other number of emotions we attach to things, and then we can't stop. 
Once we are in control of our thinking, we can intercede in these runaway 
reflexes and stop them. 

Give yourself a goal in meditation to stop smoking and let your spirit come 
forward and direct your subconscious to quit. We have trouble changing 
our thinking because we are weak at controlling things. Your spirit is not 


weak and can overcome simple problems quite easily. 

 

Spiritual Bonding 

Throughout the book I have made several references to spiritual bonding. 
This phrase means that you become connected or bonded at a spiritual 
level with some other life form. This refers not only to your connection to 
Creation, but to all life forms, including other humans, animals, plants, and 
to the entire universe. You see, spiritual bonding is the process of 
projecting your own spiritual energy out and making contact with spiritual 
energy from any other source. 

Meditation teaches us some of the basic principles of controlling our 
thinking and allows us to develop control over our thoughts and our level 
of consciousness. We have already talked about some of the basic 
principles of pausing, flashing, and concentration that contribute to 
balanced thinking. We also now understand the value of controlling our 
negative and positive thoughts in order to find that balanced level. 
Meditation can then be a valuable utility in developing the state of mind 
that is best for spiritual bonding, thereby making it easier to return to that 
state whenever necessary. 

You see, we are all spiritually bonded to one another all of the time. 
Whether we are aware of it or not, our thinking creates energy that is 
projected in the aura around our bodies. As we come in close contact with 
others, our auric field touches theirs and affects them. Normally our aura 
only extends a few inches out from our bodies. When the power of our 
thoughts becomes more concentrated, our auric fields can extend out for 
several feet and have a much larger effect. 

If our thoughts are negative or hostile, we harm those around us; if they 


are loving and understanding, we can warm their hearts and fill them with 
happiness. If one thousand people get together and become hostile all at 
once, they create a huge field of energy that starts affecting others, and 
pretty soon you have an angry mob on your hands. If the one thousand 
grows to millions who learn to hate, all of society is affected. 

Did you ever stop to think about what the planet and nature must do to 
defend themselves from the huge field of energy that is built up by billions 
of illogical, prejudiced, and hateful people? At this level of energy the 
planet and nature are stirred up, and we have the human contribution to 
earthquakes, volcanoes, and other natural disasters. 

The planet Earth currently supports over five billion humans who are 
thinking and creating a mass consciousness that forms an energy ring 
around the entire planet. Not only is it affecting nature, but this large 
consciousness extends out into the universe and is felt by other 
civilizations as well. Most of the effect is here on Earth. It is the people who 
create it who are the most affected. If we damage nature, then we are 
hurting the food chain that supports us, the air we breathe, and the water 
we drink. On the other hand, if through the use of the boomerang we can 
clean up our thinking, we could get all five billion people to think with 
balanced thoughts of love and human kindness and create a beautiful 
world of peace and harmony. The key to doing this is to start with 
ourselves, and then share the process with others until we have changed 
mass consciousness through wisdom. Let me give you an idea of how we 
can do this. 

Growing up in small towns in Kansas, I was always close to nature. It was 
a very normal thing for me to sit under a tree and talk to it like a friend, or 
sit by the river for hours and communicate with the energy flowing by me. 
All of the birds, animals, and natural vegetation around me were my 


friends. I had developed my own way of communicating with the universe 
through a little system that I would like to share with you. Meditation will 
teach you the basics of thought control, but the ultimate goal is spiritually 
bonding with the universe around you and contributing something useful. 

 

The Steps to Spiritual Bonding 

Find a good spot to commune with nature. It could be a park, forest, 
garden, or just in your own backyard. It should be a quiet place where you 
won't be disturbed for a while. 

Calm yourself and get into a balanced state with some basic meditation 
methods of breath control. Become an observer and begin to become 
aware of everything around you. Shed any need for attention, approval, 
or control. 

Shift your eyes out of focus and learn to observe the aura of energy that 
is around everything. Notice the colors in the auras around the trees and 
flowers. Even rocks and stones give off energy that is perceptible. 

Let your mind become aware that everything you see and feel is a part of 
the universe and is of equal importance, including yourself. 

Pause and let the unconditional love of the universe around you present 
itself. Nothing in nature hates or demands anything from you. You can 
only receive unconditional peace and love from nature. 

Form the idea in your mind that you equally love everything in the 
universe. Add respect, peace, integrity, and the feeling that you are giving 
freely and want nothing in return. 

Push that idea of love out from yourself and let it bathe the whole 
universe. Within a few seconds the universe will respond and return the 


feeling of unconditional love back to you, only much stronger. Create no 
new thoughts, and observe your energy flow out from your body and 
spiritually bond with everything around you. You will begin to feel lighter 
and start losing the sensation of your body. Make no conscious thought 
about this. 

Again push out your feelings of unconditional love and let it flow outward. 
Try to observe the energy of your thoughts as it bonds with all around 
you. 

Shift your attention to the trees, pause for a few minutes, and then shift 
your attention to the river, and then to the flowers. Spend a few minutes 
with each life form within your awareness in order to become friends. 
Sense their energy, learn their names, and feel what they can tell you 
about themselves. Give each observation a few minutes. You will be 
surprised at what you can learn from nature. 

Observe the knowledge, intuitions, and sensations that come into your 
spirit. You will be receiving answers to your questions and visions of your 
future. Contemplate the meaning of all of your connections in life, and you 
will discover their meaning. Accidents in life are only material perceptions 
that are understood by the spirit. Here, they can all be explained. Feel the 
level of your consciousness increase to new heights anal the energy that 
flows into your body. You should strive to raise your level of consciousness 
each time you do this. It is while you are spiritually bonded with the 
universe that you can improve your health and increase your life span. 

 

Peace on Earth 

Man is always talking about peace on Earth. I have an idea how we can 
start a spiritual bonding practice that will produce peace between people. If 


it catches on, it could end prejudice, hate, anger, fear, and the other 
negative feelings that prevent peace. 

Once a day sit down in a public place where there are many people. A park 
would be a good place. Get into a comfortable position and relax yourself. 
Now let your eyes fall on someone who will stay in one place long enough 
for you to concentrate on them. 

Begin your meditation/concentration on this individual, using the basic 
power of observation that you learned in the breathing exercise. In other 
words, concentrate on the individual without any material thoughts of 
recognition. Turn off all thoughts, feelings, and preconceived ideas about 
what a human being is. Feel your mind move into the familiar position of 
balance that allows you to begin the spiritual connection. 

Form the thought of unconditional love in your mind, and let it flow out 
towards that individual. Shift your eyes out of focus and see the energy of 
your love actually flow around them and engulf their aura. As the 
concentration develops, you will no longer see a material person. Their 
color, size, gender, looks, and all that you normally perceive will disappear 
as your perception turns from the material senses to spiritual awareness. 
When you see another as a spiritual being, you cannot feel any hatred, 
anger, or prejudice. Their spirit will send energy impulses to you, and the 
spiritual bonding that connects you together will happen. Within an instant 
you will feel the awareness that lets you know that you are both creatures 
of Creation. In this mental state you can only know love and peace for one 
another. 

As you leave the concentration and return to your normal senses, you will 
bring with you the feelings of love and spiritual bonding that you felt in the 
concentration. There is now peace on Earth for you two spirits. 


Pass it on! 

 

The Story of Jmmanuel 

In our search for our identity and our role in Creation, we have created 
religions and different belief structures in order to explain the reason for 
our existence. All religions are man's attempt at explaining the "meaning 
of life." Throughout our history the meaning of our life has been 
explained through the use of idols, myths, sun gods, bird gods, and 
countless other man made philosophies which have reflected the 
understanding and intelligence of the time. 

Man must learn the lessons of life step by step. He must challenge, 
discover, and learn for himself in order to evolve. The New Age represents 
a time for a new paradigm in thinking, a time for us to search out the 
truth for ourselves. We no longer should listen to religions and 
philosophers as the absolute authority, but instead perceive their words 
only as information to be used on our own personal path of discovery. In 
our new paradigm, we will learn to take responsibility for our own 
connection to Creation, and most importantly, we will learn to find truth 
for ourselves. In this era, there will be no need for a spiritual middle-man 
who will tell us what God wants us to do. Instead, we will all learn to 
discover truth for ourselves and freely share our understandings with one 
another. Learning to face the challenges of life and taking 100% 
responsibility for our actions is truly one of the greatest lesions to be 
learned in the coming times. The leaders of the future will teach this 
concept through role-modeling and example. 

 

In ancient times gods ruled the Earth, but today man is on his 


own to discover his spiritual place in Creation. 


In the New Age, man is getting in touch with his spirit and finding out he is 
already part of Creation. We are becoming aware that we are more than 
just a material being, and that we also have a spiritual energy within us 
that is connected to the Creation itself. This spirit is an active part of our 
day-to-day existence that requires a new understanding. As we learn more 
about Creation, we learn that our spirit has unique powers which include 
telepathy, telekinesis, future vision, and most importantly, the ability o 
communicate directly with the Creation and other beings of higher 
consciousness. 

This is going to require new kinds of education, new methods, and new 
thinking. We are asking questions that the old paradigms cannot answer. 
The need for a new, practical method of understanding our spiritual self 
and applying it to our day-to-day life is here, and religion does not have 
the answers. 

If we look at the average man of 2,000 years ago, it's not hard to see how 
valuable organized religion was. It was a time of chaos, when man was 
badly in need of some kind of organized plan by which he could live his life. 
Religion provided this through organizing a logical method of explaining 
God and the meaning of man's life. First, we had the Ten Commandments 
by which man could begin to rule himself. Here were basic laws of living 
that everyone could understand and live by. 

Then through the life and teachings of Jesus, people began to understand 
their connection to God and developed a reason for being and felt closer to 
Creation. Their lives then became richer and more meaningful. Religion 
was born when these teachings were put together to form the New 


Testament. Just like in Egypt, where the Sun God reflected the 
understanding of the times, religion was formed as a reflection of the 
understanding of its time. Now 2,000 years have passed, and as we 
prepare to enter a New Age, a mere complex and sophisticated 
understanding is required. Religion in its original form has outlived itself 
and can no longer provide the answers to our questions. 

Turn inward to find answers to your questions, and you will find 
the connecting link through your spirit. 

While growing up, my parents were very involved in the Episcopal Church; 
I was an acolyte, an assistant to the priest, and almost had the entire 
Communion ceremony memorized at one time. My upbringing was very 
normal for the Midwest, and I was taught Christianity just like everyone 
else in my community. As I got older, I began to question things and 
wanted to know more. Business trips had led me to Japan, China, Europe, 
and Egypt, and I was exposed to many different views and understandings. 
I discovered that not everyone thought the same way or believed in the 
same thing. There are more philosophies, beliefs, and religions than there 
are countries. Everywhere you go, you will find a new explanation for the 
meaning of life. It was fascinating to learn new things, leading me to read 
a book about Jesus living in India. 

 

Jesus Lived in India 

During my stay at the Semjase Silver Star Center, I spent a lot of time 
reading both Billy's Contact Notes and several other books that I had 
brought with me. One of them was a book, called Jesus Lived in India, that 
was given to me by a friend before I left. It was all about the life of Jesus 
Christ and was centered on an investigation by a German historian named 


Holger Kerstein, who claimed that Jesus survived the crucifixion and lived 
in India for many years afterward. The book was his detailed report of 
years of research in Israel, Pakistan, Afghanistan, and India, where he had 
uncovered the path taken by Jesus after the crucifixion. His story told of 
the search he embarked upon to find out the truth about Jesus. He 
followed the path that Jesus had taken after the crucifixion, which led the 
historian through several countries where he discovered old scrolls and 
writings that described the man and his teachings. The book ended up with 
evidence to support the idea that Jesus had spent his last years in a place 
called Srinagar, India, where he had raised a family and passed away at a 
very old age. 

I found the book fascinating, and it was written so well, with all of his 
arguments so well supported, that in a court of law the author would surely 
win his case. Intrigued by what I read, I was anxious to find out if the 
Pleiadian material would either substantiate or repudiate the book. I knew 
that Billy had asked Semjase many questions about religion, God, and 
Jesus and that he was very well informed on this subject. Since the 
Pleiadians have the technical ability to move in time and see history for 
themselves, they have the ultimate knowledge of personal experience. 
Whatever information they may have passed on to Billy would surely be 
closer to the truth than other sources. It is quite easy to say that few 
events in history have had as much impact as the life and death of Jesus. 

 

The Life of Immanuel (Jesus Christ) 

I found Billy in the kitchen having some lunch. He knew I had been reading 
this book for days, and I think he was just waiting for me to show up with 
all of my questions. I grabbed a couple of scraps of note paper off of the 


radio and sat down. I think my first question was about what Jesus really 
looked like, and Billy took it from there. 

Billy started off by reminding me that Jesus was not his real name. The 
man we think of as Jesus was really born with the name of Jmmanuel, 
which means "God with us." Throughout his lifetime he was never called 
Jesus Christ. This was a name given to him in the year 189 A.D. by those 
who were still forming Christianity. It was also during this time that the 
teachings of Jmmanuel were being rewritten, probably to the best of their 
knowledge. In early Christian writings Jmmanuel was spelled Emmanuel, 
and it still s found in many hymn books by this spelling. In the old 
language of the Lyrans, which is still used by the Pleiadians, the spelling 
was with a J, so Billy referred to him as Jmmanuel. 

The image most of us have of Jmmanuel is that of a young man will long, 
blond hair, thin and small-boned. Billy had me stand up, and taking a few 
seconds to think about it while looking me over, said that Jmmanuel was 
actually about 5'11" tall and weighed around 175 pounds at the time of the 
crucifixion. He had black, curly hair and was large-boned with big hands. 
His skin was tanned and had the look of a working man who was outside in 
the sun a lot. 

 

His Birth 

The Pleiadians wanted to make it perfectly clear that Jmmanuel was an 
earthborn human being who lived and died as all men do. His life was that 
of a prophet who fought for the truth about the meaning of life. He became 
well educated through the wisdom of the celestial sons from the Pleiades. 
Through the force and wisdom of his spirit, he found the will to fulfill his 
mission of bringing the knowledge of Creation to Earth. His birth had been 


caused by the Pleiadians at the request of Plejos, the last Pleiadian leader 
on Earth. Plejos wanted to return to the Pleiades to live out the rest of his 
days, so he decided to leave behind a prophet who could carry on the 
teachings of Creation and the lessons of life. 

There were no longer any gods ruling over Earth, so Plejos asked for 
permission from the Pleiadian spiritual leaders to procreate the spirit of 
Jmmanuel, and permission was granted. In Jmmanuels case his spirit was 
too highly evolved to be born to normal Earth parents, so it was decided 
that his father would be a Pleiadian man of higher evolution. A Pleiadian 
named Gabriel was chosen to be the father and an Earth woman named 
Mary was chosen to carry the child. She was one of the old Lyran spirits 
who was living on Earth and her genetics would support the higher 
evolution of the incoming spirit. 

We are not told the means by which Gabriel impregnated Mary, but it is 
said that he explained to her how important it was to help with the birth of 
this most special spirit-form. She agreed, and the spirit of Jmmanuel made 
its decision to come to Earth and entered her body. Mary was betrothed to 
a man named Joseph who, when hearing of this special impregnation, 
broke out in a rage and would have nothing to do with it. He was planning 
to leave Mary and cancel their wedding plans. 

Understanding how Joseph felt, Gabriel came to him and explained the 
importance of this event, and that the god that ruled over the Earth had 
commanded this event to happen. Joseph was a god-fearing man and 
calmed down and went through with his plans to wed Mary. Jmmanuel was 
born in a manger, just as the Bible says, for there really was no room at 
the inn. 

Throughout his life Jmmanuel was aware of his true father, Gabriel, who 


visited him on several occasions. He knew that his father was not a god, 
and had been ordered by the Pleiadian spiritual leaders, who ruled over 
Earth at the time, to bring him into life. The knowledge of the Pleiadians 
was that of gods, but they chose to merely observe, for it was time for the 
people of Earth to learn self-reliance and discover their spiritual connection 
to Creation. There would be no more gods on Earth. When Jmmanuel tried 
to explain this, he discovered that the people of Earth had become 
accustomed to being ruled by a god, and the idea of taking responsibility 
for themselves would come very slowly. 

By our calendar today, Jmmanuels birthday is really February 3rd, 
not December 25th. 

 

Jmmanuels special gift was that of seeing the future. He was aware of what 
the future held for his teachings and how man would interpret them He 
knew how his name would be changed, and how man would call him the 
Son of God instead of understanding that his father was a celestial son, 
who was flesh and blood just like us. His teachings were of Creation and of 
the eternal spirit that is part of all humans. But he knew how man would 
attack his lessons to a god figure. Man still needed a god to take care of 
him; he was not ready to be responsible for himself. Too many lessons of 
life had to be learned before man could properly understand the teachings 
of Creation that he shared with them. But still, even knowing the future, he 
perceived that his life was worthwhile, and his words would provide the 
truth which would endure for all times on Earth. Eventually, his true 
teachings would once again surface in the future, serving as a guide to 
those who were ready to take the spiritual responsibility to lead the people 
of Earth into times of peace and prosperity. 


Jmmanuel traveled to India at an early age, around 13, and began his 
studies. Here he practiced meditation and learned the lessons of life from 
the great thinkers of that time. The knowledge of the East had been passed 
down for thousands of years, since the time of Atlantis when the celestial 
son and daughters from the stars populated the Earth. On several 
occasions he was visited by his father, who guided him and instructed him 
in the use of the spiritual powers which would serve him well during his 
later life. 

Truly, he was well aware of the events of the future, but felt he could do 
nothing to change them. He was born as a human being, and as such, he 
would live and fulfill his mission. The power of his spirit could easily see 
into the future and allowed him to know his destiny. He knew that as a 
human being he would suffer the fate of bodily death at the age of 115. His 
body would be very old then, but his spirit would be unbroken. The coming 
event of his crucifixion would change nothing, for the occurrence would only 
be bodily pain, which would be dispersed by the force of his spirit; then, he 
would finish his mission. All the hate levied against him did not keep him 
from his path. The truth was more important than the pain of the body, 
which passes away. He could be tortured and destroyed, but the truth and 
his spirit could not be harmed. 

 

The Writings of Jmmanuel 

I was interested in any teachings that Jmmanuel may have written in his 
lifetime that the Pleiadians knew about. Growing up as a Christian, I was 
aware of the gospels of Matthew and Mark and how the New Testament 
had been centered around them, but I wanted to know why there were not 
any original writings by Jmmanuel himself, so we could know what his real 


words were. 

Billy had asked these same questions of the Pleiadians and had been told 
that during Jmmanuels time, there were few who could read and write, so 
the necessity to write down his teachings was minimal. He planned to do it 
after the crucifixion, returning to India where he had learned the lessons of 
spirit and living a long and prosperous life. At that time his teachings were 
written down by Judas Iscarioth, who was his scribe and good friend, not is 
betrayer as is commonly believed. 

The Pleiadians also wanted to make it clear that these teachings were 
merely being handed down by Jmmanuel, for he had learned them himself 
from his Pleiadian father, Gabriel, and the learned men of India, who had 
taught him so well during his early years of living there. Indeed, his 
teachings would be written down and buried in a safe place for the future. 

These teachings which were written by his scribe, Judas Iscarioth, and 
added to by his son, Joseph, made it through the ages, so the truth would 
endure for posterity. The people of his father, the Pleiadians, would see to 
it that the writings would be found in the future and become accessible to 
the Earth human beings. But he knew then that even 2,000 years in the 
future, man would not be mature enough, and it would take another 200 
years before the grain of truth would find a bit of nourishable soil. 

 

Judas Was Not the Betrayer 

Judas Iscarioth was not the betrayer of Jmmanuel, as we have been old 
over the years. One of Judas' scripts was stolen so that it could be used as 
evidence against Jmmanuel by a Pharisee's son by the name of Juda 
Iharioth. He secretly took the script from the bag of Judas Iscarioth and 
sold it for 70 silvers to the scribes and Pharisees, who were pursuing 


Jmmanuel. This would enable them to accuse Jmmanuel of blasphemy. 
Judas Iscarioth would have to write the text another time and preserve it 
well to endure the times. 

The father of this man Juda Iharioth, who was the real traitor, wanted to 
hide his son's guilt and protect the family name, so he announced to the 
people that the traitor was the scribe of Jmmanuel, named Judas Iscarioth. 
Because of his power and standing in the community, his words were 
believed. This worked well for the scribes and Pharisees, as the people now 
would believe that one from his own ranks had betrayed him and 
surrendered him for the death on the cross. They would wonder how his 
lessons could be truthful if his own followers would betray him and sell him 
out. It was really Juda Iharioth who hung himself in the blood acre, not 
Judas Ischarioth, his friend who traveled on and continued to be his scribe. 

 

The Crucifixion 

Jmmanuel came before Pontius Pilate, who did not want to sentence him, 
leaving it up to the people, who yelled for his blood. He was to be crucified 
on the cross along with two murderers. As the crowd yelled, he was beaten 
badly. Most of his ribs were broken and he could barely stand. He was not 
even able to carry the cross, requiring the help of a man called Simon. At a 
place called Golgatha, he was nailed to the cross, and then raised into the 
air for all to see. It was most unusual for anyone to be nailed to the cross; 
it was customary to be tied, but the crowd and the soldiers had been 
greatly stirred up into a frenzy of hate by the high priests. 

After Jmmanuel had been left on the cross, a terrible storm started that 
filled the sky with blackness and lasted for three hours. At the end of the 
storm his head suddenly fell forward, and he slipped into a coma, causing 


the soldiers to think he was dead. A lance was used to pierce his loins to 
see if he was alive, and when blood mixed with water came out, the soldier 
felt his life was slipping away. He called out that Jmmanuel was dead. 

In the crowd was Joseph of Arimathea, who was a follower of Jmmanuel. 
He could tell that he was not dead, but had slipped into a coma brought on 
by the many broken bones and terrible beating he had suffered. Jmmanuel 
was strong in spirit, but this much damage to his body was even too much 
for him. 

Joseph received permission from Pontius Pilate to take Jmmanuel down 
from the cross and bury him. He then found some friends of Jmmanuels 
from India who were there, and with their help, took him to the tomb that 
Joseph had built for himself. It had a secret entrance, so he and the men 
from India could come and go as they pleased without being noticed by the 
soldiers, who had been left to guard the entrance. It took three days for 
Jmmanuels health to return to the point where he could walk again. He had 
been nursed well by the men from India, who had brought with them 
special oils and salves which helped to revive him. 

After Jmmanuel had left the tomb through the secret back entrance, there 
was a great roar in the air and a bright light appeared, out of which 
stepped Gabriel, his Pleiadian father. He put the soldiers to sleep, rolled 
back the great stone that covered the entrance and let Jmmanuels mother, 
Mary, and Mary Magdalene into the tomb to see that he was gone. They 
were told to go into the city and tell his disciples that Jmmanuel had risen 
and to meet him on the road to Galilee, but not to tell anyone else. 

Jmmanuel appeared two more times before his disciples, once in the room 
where they had just gathered a few days before to celebrate the Last 
Supper, and again on the road to Galilee. He then disappeared and was 


dropped off by his father in Syria, and lived in Damascus without being 
recognized. 

 

Jmmanuel and Saul 

It was at this time that he was joined by his brother, Thomas, and his 
mother. His brother informed him of the terrible things that were being 
done to his followers by Saul. Jmmanuel told him not to worry; he would 
take care of it. Saul would be later known as Paul, and for the most part, 
he was responsible for the creation of Christianity. It was his understanding 
of Jmmanuels teachings that survived to help form the New Testament. 

Thomas informed Jmmanuel that Saul had become a bitter enemy and was 
issuing threats against any who would believe in him. He was even writing 
letters to the synagogues in neighboring countries to find any who would 
follow Jmmanuels teachings, so he could bring them to Jerusalem for 
persecution. 

Jmmanuel decided to take care of Saul himself and went about his plan. He 
knew that Saul was on his way to Damascus, so he planned to confront 
him on the road and teach him a lesson he would not forget. Since Saul 
believed him to be dead, he would think he was seeing a ghost. 

Jmmanuel prepared himself with some secret things—powders, salve and 
liquids—and left the city and hid along the road, waiting for Saul. During 
the night he saw a group of men approaching along the road and could see 
Saul among them. Jmmanuel started a fire, mixed it with his special 
preparation, and created a tremendously bright light which blinded the 
group. As the smoke covered the men on the road, Jmmanuel yelled out so 
that Saul could hear him. Hearing the voice of Jmmanuel, Saul thought he 
was hearing a ghost and became very afraid. Jmmanuel continued to speak 


through the smoke, telling Saul to go into the city and let his disciples 
teach him how to live. Jmmanuel then disappeared into the night and 
headed for Damascus. 

Saul and all of his men thought they had heard a ghost and were frozen 
with fear. They could not imagine how Jmmanuel could be speaking to 
them from the grave. Scared and confused, they continued on to 
Damascus. A disciple of Jmmanuels preached to Saul the new teachings so 
that he would slowly understand. Still afraid, though, Saul was slightly 
confused; therefore, he didn't understand very much. 

Saul was of the belief, as were the high priests of that time that once you 
died it was possible to resurrect the dead; they did not believe in 
reincarnation. Because of that, when Saul heard the sound of Jmmanuels 
voice and saw the light, he thought he was resurrected, and began to use 
this in his teachings. This is where the idea originated that Jmmanuel arose 
from the dead and was resurrected. Saul had no idea that Jmmanuel had 
ever died, but had only tricked him. 

Jmmanuel, his brother Thomas, Judas Ischarioth, and his mother then 
began the long trip to India. During that time he preached in many 
countries and often had to flee because his speeches were so 
revolutionary. That is why his journey to India took several years and was 
connected with treat hardships. 

In the country which today is called West Pakistan, way up in the north 
near the last foothills of the Western Himalayan Mountains, his mother 
became very ill and died when Jmmanuel was about 38 years old. She was 
buried in a little town which today is called Mari, Pakistan. A small tone 
monument marks the grave where she lies. After he lost his mother, 
Jmmanuel traveled to the area known as Kashmir, which crosses the 


northern part of India, where he continued to spread his teachings further. 

When he was about 45 years old, he married a young, pretty woman who 
bore him numerous offspring. Like every normal head of a family, he 
decided to settle down and raise his family, living in Srinagar, India, which 
is located in the northernmost part of the country. From there he made 
many journeys and kept on preaching his new teachings. At the age of 
about 115, he died a natural death and was buried outside of town in an 
unknown grave. 

Judas Ischarioth died at the age of about 90 and was buried at a place not 
far from Srinagar. But the first-born son of Jmmanuel, called Joseph, wrote 
down his father's story and left India after his death. After a three-year 
journey he settled in Jerusalem to live out his remaining days. He brought 
with him the original scrolls of his father's teachings, and hid then in the 
tomb in which Jmmanuel had originally lain. He thought that this would be 
the safest place. 

 

The Talmud of Jmmanuel 

It wasn't until 1963 that the Pleiadians led a Greek Catholic priest named 
Rashid, to the site where the scrolls were buried. The writings had been 
placed into resin and were kept in a crystal-like box given to Jmmanuel by 
his father, Gabriel, when he was young, just for this purpose. Written in 
old Aramaic script, the scrolls were found under the flat rock where they 
had been hidden almost 2,000 years earlier by Jmmanuels son, Joseph. 

Rashid began translating the scrolls from Aramaic into German and 
making copies, for he knew it would be his job to bring them to the world. 
The scrolls were long and contained over 120 chapters of information. So 
far he had only sent 36 of them to Billy in Switzerland. 


Hiding out in Baghdad with his family, the good priest was being followed 
by assassins from both the Christian and Jewish faiths. Fleeing for his life 
to Lebanon, he camped there with his family in a refugee camp. But he 
and his family were found by the Jewish military, who attacked the camp 
and slaughtered most of the refugees. Barely escaping the massacre with 
his family, he fled into the night, at the cost of losing the scrolls. 

Shortly afterward, the priest and his family were murdered by a terrorist 
gang who machine-gunned them down in hatred and anger. Only the 36 
chapters which he had translated survived; the fate of the original scrolls 
is unknown. They have been translated into English, and today are 
available in a small book called The Talmud of Jmmanuel. 

Published by Wild Flower Press in America, it also comes with a 
companion book called Celestial Teachings, written by Dr. James 
Deardorff, a Christian historian. This book is the result of six years of 
study on The Talmud of Jmmanuel to determine its validity. 

 

The Lord's Prayer 

In school and in church most of us learned the Lord's Prayer. In The 
Talmud of Jmmanuel we read it in a slightly different way. Jmmanuel was 
trying to teach those around him how to become aware of the spirit within 
us and our connection to Creation. No one understood the concept of 
meditation that he was trying to teach them, but instead they thought it 
was a prayer to God to help them. Being misunderstood, the Lord's Prayer 
was written down in The Talmud of Jmmanuel the way that Jmmanuel had 
first spoken and taught it to his disciples. It was a meditation called My 
Spirit. Here is the Lord's Prayer in its original form, taken from The 
Talmud of Jmmanuel, the original writings of Jmmanuel. (Reprinted with 


 

My Spirit 

(Known as the Lord's Prayer) 

My Spirit, you are omnipotent, your name is holy. May your kingdom be 
incarnate in me. May your power reveal itself within me, 
on Earth and in the heavens. Give me today my daily bread, and thus let 
me recognize my sins, and I shall recognize the truth. Do not lead me into 
temptation and confusion, but deliver me from error. For yours is the 
kingdom within me and the power and knowledge forever. 

Amen. (I agree) 

 

The Mysteries of Earth 

The Pleiadian contacts in Switzerland continued for almost three years; 
during this time they answered many questions put to them by Billy, 
members of the F.I.G.U., his friends, and family members. Centered 
around the many unexplainable events of Earth's history, most of the 
answers provide an insight into our past that does not appear anywhere 
in our school books. I'm sure if given the opportunity, most of us would 
ask many of the same questions about the mysteries of Earth. 

 

What Is the Mystery of the Bermuda Triangle? 

A mystery that has long plagued us is the strange disappearance of ships 
and planes in the area known as the Bermuda Triangle. Many books have 
been written on the subject, offering a variety of theories on the 
unexplainable disappearances of ships, planes, and people. It has even 
been suggested by some that the peculiar events surrounding the 


Bermuda Triangle may be caused by ETs, Satan, or some other dark 
force. 

To the Pleiadians, the events in the Triangle are not caused by any 
extraterrestrial influence. As a matter of fact, even ET ships have been 
affected by the phenomena from time to time. As far as the Pleiadians are 
concerned, the events of the Bermuda Triangle are quite logically 
explained. Actually, there have been three different places on the planet 
Earth where similar effects have occurred. Old pirate stories have done 
much to lend an aura of intrigue and mystery to the subject. 

The area called the Bermuda Triangle is part of the old continent of 
Atlantis, which extended from the west coast of Africa all the way to the 
east coast of South America, and northward to the area where Florida is 
now. It is in this location that the descendants of this lost continent still 
live, in a base far beneath the sea. They are quite peaceful, and do not 
represent a threat to the surface world of Earth. They have ships capable 
of underwater travel and interstellar flight, and have been seen entering 
and leaving the water on occasion. But this is not the cause of the strange 
disappearances. 

There exists in the Triangle, as well as off the coast of Japan and 
Madagascar, what you might call a dimensional door to a Parallel 
Universe. In an effort to explain it, the Pleiadians took Billy into the 
Parallel Universe so he could see for himself. As the ship entered the 
dimensional door, Billy noticed that he could see our present-time Earth 
behind the ship, and in front of him he could see the Parallel Universe with 
three Earths looming into view. It was necessary to make the trip in one 
of the more advanced Pleiadian craft because the small Beamships would 
not be capable of returning. 


It was explained that the dimensional doors are caused by the effect of 
two giant suns located 720 light years from our Earth. Certain high-
energy radiations from these two giant bodies occasionally come together 
at certain points on our planet. When their energies cross, it forms a rip 
or tear in the fabric of time, causing unpredictable results wherever the 
rip occurs. Since the Earth is moving, this radiation most commonly hits 
the planet in three different locations—the Bermuda Triangle, off the 
coast of Japan, and near to Madagascar. This only occurs at that time 
when the Earth moves into the focus of this wandering radiation. This 
crossing of energies serves to open a dimensional door to the Parallel 
Universes. This effect is erratic and unpredictable and disturbs the 
magnetic energy in the area for a short time. On many occasions in the 
past, it has caused the floor of the ocean to rise up and appear as an 
island for an hour or so. Ships in the night have run aground, only to be 
pulled down when the ocean floor sinks. Airplanes have flown into this 
dimensional door, which acts like a cyclone, and they have found 
themselves displaced in time forever. In most cases, ships and places that 
have entered these areas slip forward in time and will probably reappear 
in the near future. 

In the Parallel Universe, entered through the Bermuda Triangle, there 
exist three Earths, caused by an accident 3,500 years ago when the 
planet Venus came too close to the Earth, disturbing the harmony of both 
of the dimensions and the two planets closest to the sun, Mercury and 
Earth. A rip or tear in time resulted and caused two different Earths from 
different time epochs to be pulled into the dimension of the future planet. 
Because of this, there are three planets now existing in our Parallel 
Universe—the ancient prehistoric Earth, a newly formed Earth which is 
still covered in gas, and a third future Earth, existing as we know it in the 


present. 

These three planets are close together, and they can be seen by the 
human eye at the same time. The future Earth is approximately five 
hundred years in advance of us. A society has developed there with space 
travel abilities, which has led to cities on the Moon and beyond. The 
Pleiadians are careful not to let themselves be known to this future 
society, for they regard them as still too aggressive to get along with. It is 
interesting to note, though, that five hundred years into our future some 
form of our society does till exist. With all of the drama of survival here on 
Earth today, our future is certainly in question. 

The prehistoric Earth is one which existed at the time of the dinosaurs. This 
was the state of the second planet, a prehistoric world with no sign of 
human life. Billy was so intrigued with the dinosaurs on the planet that he 
talked Semjase into letting him get out of the ship and touch one while it 
had been temporarily paralyzed by her technology. He even took a couple 
of pictures which, oddly enough, show a dinosaur with a large pyramid in 
the background. This seems very unusual since man did not exist on Earth 
when the dinosaurs roamed the Earth, so who built them? 

The third planet Earth is one which is only just now forming from gas into 
solid matter, and represents the very beginnings of our present day planet. 
Not yet in solid form, it presented little or no interesting features and was 
not explored. 

Earth has since moved out of the position where it is affected by the 
crossing of the strange radiations from the giant suns, so the dimensional 
doors should be closed forever. Because of this, we should not be plagued 
with any more disappearances or strange stories from this area, at least 
the ones caused by this strange energy. It should be noted, though, that 


the area of the Bermuda Triangle is known for its sudden storms that can 
still cause problems, but these storms do not have the capability to move 
objects in time or interfere with the magnetic forces of the planet. 


Who Was the Warrior Called Quetzalcoatl? 

He was a very high-ranking officer of an extraterrestrial group that was 
exercising control over Egypt for a short time. He was wise and kind and 
was often sent on special missions. One of the missions took him to South 
America, where he was praised as a god by the Aztecs. He came into 
contact with Huitzilopochtli, a leader of the Gizeh people, who led the 
Aztecs into creating the ritual of human blood sacrifices. Quetzalcoatl was 
against these rituals and a bitter feud developed for power. In the end 
Huitzilopochtli was able to drive Quetzalcoatl out, forcing his return to 
Egypt. 


Are There ETs Living under Mount Shasta in California? 

Today, under a mountain in northern California, there exists a race of 
extraterrestrials called Hyperborean’s. This mountain is called Mt. Shasta. 
The entrance to their city is high on the eastern side of the mountain and 
inaccessible to us. Their ships are gold in color and are sometimes seen 
entering or leaving the mountain. They are white-skinned people who 
usually have long, curly, blond hair. They sometimes come out of the 
mountain to local towns, but are very shy toward Earth people. They are 
the descendants of the ancient Hyperborean’s who came to Earth over 
30,000 years ago. 


What Is the Purpose of an Ice Age? 


Known to us as a glacial period, this is a natural event in the development 
of the planet. We have to accept the fact that the planet is living entity, 
and it must evolve just as we must. Since it does not reach for perfection 
as we do or go through periods of material life and nonmaterial life 
(sleeping), it has its own way of evolving. This is done through an event 
called an ice age, or glacial period. This is a natural process, covering 
entire regions or even the entire planet with ice. Temperatures fall, and 
changes occur in atmospheric pressure. As a planet ages, the amount of 
ice subsides 

Ice ages occur in rhythmic patterns in accordance with the size and type of 
planet. The time of an ice age can be determined by simple mathematics. 
On Earth, this cycle lasts about 700,000 years, which means that every 
700,000 years a certain region of Earth will fall into an ice age and cover 
from 1/6 to 1/4 of the entire surface of the planet. The periods in between 
are interglacial periods, where from 1/10 to 1/12 of the Earth will be 
covered. We have had four glacial periods in the last three million years, 
and we are only 150,000 years away from the next interglacial period and 
550,000 years from another great glacial period. 

All forms of creation go through a process of waking and sleeping. The 
Earth is no exception. As the Earth has become more evolved, less area of 
the planet is covered in ice (sleeping) because this would damage some of 
the other life forms on it. This ice age, or sleeping period, serves as an 
evolution time for the plants, animals, and humans. This means that a 
beautiful flower changes into a still more beautiful one. Animals also 
evolve; for instance, the prehistoric mammoth has become the elephant. 


The Ozone Problem 


For many years the Pleiadians have controlled the dangerous effects we 
have caused by our irresponsibility toward nature. Many different chemicals 
are discharged into the atmosphere, including bromine gas, which slowly 
dissolve the ozone layer. As early as 1975 they informed us that the ozone 
layer is 6.38% affected and destroyed. This began 60 years earlier. It 
allows ultraviolet radiation into the atmosphere, affecting all creatures. 
There are currently three different areas where the danger exists. Bromine 
gas is not the only source of the problem. Our scientists are aware that 
explosion motors and matter-destroying processes of other sorts, including 
atom-splitting devices, also contribute to the problem. 

Since 1945 the problem has increased greatly, due to the splitting of the 
atom. Some governments have designed missiles that release bromine gas into the 
atmosphere as a weapon, stupidly thinking that such an action would be 
harmless to their own country. To close these ozone holes may take 
hundreds of years. The problem looks worse when we realize that the holes 
can wander. 

The splitting of the atom is also a far greater danger than we realize. 
Setting atomic energies free through the use of nuclear plants, atomic 
testing, and explosion motors releases electrical energies at very high 
frequencies. This is not to be confused with what we think of as electricity. 
It’s a different kind of energy that affects the ultraviolet radiation field, 
which our scientists are not aware of yet. Normally, this energy mingles 
with oxygen to generate huge quantities of ozone. Normally, there is 1 part 
ozone to 500,000 parts air. When an explosion occurs due to atom 
splitting, the ozone value increases to 28 parts. These dangerous energies 
then destroy m any varieties of microorganisms important to the 
preservation of all Earthly life. The ozone value then decreases very 
rapidly. The effects of these energies can continue for hundreds of years. 


Atomic explosions also affect the Van Allen belt by disturbing the electrons 
and photons important to the function of Earth life. The belt exists at a 
height of 620 miles and consists of charged particles in constant motion, 
traveling in a spiral-like course from pole to pole. The problem is worse 
today, just as predicted. Try to educate yourself about this problem and 
make your voice heard. We are in serious danger. 


Who Built the Statues on Easter Island? 

The occurrences on Easter Island are connected to the city of Tiahuanaco, 
a pre-Incan culture that existed 300 B.C. to 900 A.D., chiefly in Peru and 
Bolivia. Even though they are more than 3,000 miles apart, they were 
ruled by the same leader and represent the last colonization of ETs in this 
area around 13,000 years ago. Out of this group came a semi-Ishwish 
leader named Viracocoha, who was very greedy for power. He conquered 
to 12,000 foot high city of Tiahuanaco and then settled on a small island n 
oar Easter Island called Mot, which means "bird" in the old language. He 
and his followers were Lyrans with giant bodies, around thirty feet tall. 
They taught the local natives how to use their highly developed machines, 
which were then used by the natives, out of tribute, to construct the 
statues we see today on Easter Island. 

Similar events also happened in Peru near the cities of Pisco, Nazca, and 
Sacsayhuaman. On lava walls on Easter Island there are reproductions of 
spaceships that were made by the local people who lived there. These were 
attempts at telling the story of Viracocoha and his reign over them. After 
several thousand years, the giants suddenly became ill from disease and 
fled Earth in their ships, taking all their technology with them. Where they 
landed is not known. It is presumed they died in their ships. 


Many of the statues were never finished. The natives tried finishing them 
with primitive stones and failed. They apparently tried to get the gods back 
by finishing the statues with red hats made from clay from a local volcano. 
The Pleiadians have been able to ascertain that the giants were somehow 
in contact with a race of humans in Andromeda, prompting an expedition 
by the Andromedans to Earth 2,568 years ago. These humans from 
Andromeda were around 5 foot 10 inches tall. They stayed for 20 years 
and 7 months, building up an advanced culture. They are responsible for 
constructing the Nazca lines, half-tube channels that protect electrical 
energy centers buried in the ground. The Andromedans could not acclimate 
themselves to the Earthly atmosphere and were forced to leave in order to 
save their lives. 

 

Who Were the Giants and Gods of Greek Mythology? 

Over the years, many races of titans have colonized many parts of the 
world. Some of the ancient Lyrans who came to Earth were 25–35 feet tall. 
Many of the Greek gods were among these. Hercules was over 10 feet 11. 
He and many of the Greek gods were descendants of the Hyperborean’s. 
Noah was around 12 feet tall, and Adam was almost 16 feet tall. The great 
god of the Sumerians, Gilgamesh, was more than 24 feet tall. 

Many of our ancestors were giants who, by interbreeding and adjusting to 
our atmosphere, have become smaller. Ancient dwarf races are likewise 
becoming larger as they evolve. After adjusting to their planet, the present 
day Pleiadians, whose ancestors were also giants, are about the same size 
as we are. 

 

The Three Great Pyramids 


The age of the pyramids has always puzzled the historians and scientists 
because the clues left behind for examination are confusing. The Great 
Pyramid of Gizeh, sometimes called Cheops or Gizeh Pyramid, stands just 
south of Cairo on a great plateau of land along with two other pyramids, 
which are smaller and built at different times by different techniques. The 
Great Pyramid or Gizeh Pyramid as it is called, covers 13 acres, using 6 1/2 
million tons of stone, and stands 481 feet tall with its capstone in place. It 
was built 73,300 years prior to 1956 at a time when the constellation Ra 
stood in the star sign of Cancer. At the time the Gizeh Pyramid was built, 
there were also two other pyramids built of the same design and for the 
same purpose. One of them is in China and is buried deep under the 
ground; it may not be discovered for some time. There is also another one 
somewhere in South America that is just below the surface of the ground; 
it may be discovered sometime soon. 

The pyramids were built by a group of Lyrans who designed them for their 
own needs. When this race vanished, the Great Pyramid stood uncared for 
and ignored for many years. It wasn't until three hundred years before the 
Great Flood that once again the Pyramid was of interest. By the way, the 
Great Flood is incorrectly thought to be around 9,000 years ago, but 
Pleiadian information tells us that it was really in the year 8,104 B. 0. It 
was during this time that there lived a king, named Sahluk, who had a son 
named Saurid, who had the gift of seeing the future and often informed his 
father of events that would come to pass. 

Saurid had a dream that a great planet would come dangerously close to 
the Earth, causing tremendous noise and darkness. Earth would be thrown 
into great upheavals of water, avalanches, and darkness. The loss of life 
would be great. Saurid told his father of his dream and of the 
consequences of it. Knowing his son had a great gift of vision, the wise 


king counseled with his scientists to verify the time this event would 
happen. It was discovered that a great comet was indeed going to come 
very close to the Earth, causing the events of the dream to happen in 
about three hundred years. 

It was decided to warn the people of the future by leaving a message on 
the Pyramid. By order of the king, the story of the dream was handed 
down from one king after another, who all prepared the Pyramid as a place 
of refuge. Lime mortar was used to cover the Pyramid so that it would be 
safe from the water. Once the mortar had sealed the entire Pyramid, the 
story of the dream was pressed into the side of the Pyramid, so the people 
of the future could not miss it. 

When the time came and the Great Destroyer Comet was approaching 
Earth, the people took heed and went into the Pyramid for shelter. The 
events of the dream came true, for the Comet turned the Earth on its axis 
and caused great flooding and destruction all over the planet. The area of 
Egypt was flooded and was under water for several years. Most of the 
people of Earth were killed, and only a few managed to survive in the large 
underground caverns that had been hollowed out under the Pyramid. 
Thousands of people were able to live for many years in the subterranean 
world until the waters subsided. Once again the Pyramid had served a 
useful purpose. Historians have been misled by the material which covers 
the surface of the Pyramid and by documents and writings which tell of the 
Pyramid being built by the Egyptians. It was built by the ancient sons and 
daughters of the heavenly sons, the star travelers, who are the essential 
settlers of this world. The Egyptians have only remodeled the Pyramid on 
several occasions for their own needs. 

The ancient heavenly sons who built the pyramids were well informed 
about the future of Earth, including the future which still faces us in this 


century. Because of their great knowledge, the Pyramid of Gizeh was built 
with the mathematical ability to tell us about coming events—particularly 
events which will affect us from outer space. The changing position of 
Earth and its axis was even taken into consideration, for they felt the need 
to let us know about certain events to come, including the fate of the 
Earth. A prophecy was built into the Pyramid to warn those in the future. 
The exact time of the event of cosmic destruction is when the solar light of 
the Central Sun of the Milky Way, as well as the light of our own solar sun, 
falls through the tube-like opening which reaches from the outside of the 
Gizeh Pyramid to the center in a straight, uninterrupted line and shines on 
one particular point. More was not told about this, for only those with the 
ability to unravel and figure out the math would be allowed to know the 
exact date of the cosmic event. The idea is that if you do not have the 
wisdom to solve a puzzle or riddle, then you are probably not ready to be 
responsible with the answer. 

 

Are There ETs Living under the Great Pyramid? 

A group of extraterrestrials originally called the Bafath came from e far 
regions of the Ring Nebula. They are the ancestors of the leaser Arussem, 
who was exiled around 3,300 years ago with 72,000 of his followers. They 
secretly returned to Earth and hid under the Gizeh plateau which supports 
the Great Cheops Pyramid. The Great Pyramid had been built by their 
Lyran ancestors about 73,475 years ago. At the time, it served as the top 
of a small underground city where they lived. 

The Bafath creatures are a wicked group who would like to rule the Earth. 
For almost 2,000 years they have tried to take over the Earth by 
controlling the minds of religious and political leaders through telepathic 


means. 

For many years the Bafath have controlled many religious leaders, causing 
confusion and wars among the people. They have also caused illusions of 
religious saints to come into the minds of people, causing them to fall 
further into delusion and illogical thinking. 

The Bafath caused the Waldport, Oregon incident in September of 1975, 
where people were giving up their worldly possessions to leave Earth in a 
spaceship. They were told the end of the Earth was near and that they 
could be saved. After the Pleiadians became aware of the interference of 
the Bafath and their control over the people of Waldport, they intervened 
and brought the incident to an end. 

An American named Reinhold Schmidt was controlled telepathically by the 
Bafath to believe he had been in the pyramid to see the crucifixion tools. 
He also was fooled into thinking that he had a ride in a spaceship to the 
Arctic. This was all illusion, caused by telepathy, to control the poor man. 
He is not lying because he actually believes it to be true. During the year 
1976, 723 persons were under the telepathic control of the Bafath. 

After causing many problems for the Pleiadians during their Mission to 
Earth, it was decided to remove the Bafath from Earth, so they would not 
be able to cause any more problems for the people here. They were 
captured and placed on other worlds. One of the Pleiadian leaders, named 
Ptaah, also affected their spirit-forms in some fashion, so they would not 
be able to reincarnate for several thousand years. This will, in effect, 
ensure that they can no longer interfere in the affairs of Earth. 

 

Was Adolf Hitler Influenced by ETs? 

The Pleiadians say that Adolf Hitler was born a person of very great worth. 


He was not spiritually advanced, but was of very high intelligence. He was 
destined to bring great change to the world through his intellect. Through 
the Thule Society in Germany, the Bafath were able to seize possession of 
Adolf and to use him for their dark and evil purposes, something he could 
not defend himself against. Many around him were also controlled. 

Hitler became convinced that he was doing the right thing for Earth, and 
set out to create a master race that would bring the world to new heights 
of civilization. His out-of-control ego and desire for power made him easy 
prey for the implanted thoughts of the Bafath. The world came to hate him, 
without really understanding what had happened. 

 

Is There Really an ET Named Ashtar? 

Kamagol was an evil leader of the Bafath. In 1937 a commander of his 
named Aruseak, known to some as Ashtar Sheran, fled the tyranny of his 
rule in his own personal effort to know the truth. He and his men left the 
Earth to get away from the power of Kamagol and make a better life for 
themselves. 

Since the Bafath are no longer on Earth and Kamagol has passed away, it 
has been safe for Ashtar to make contact with some of those on Earth. He 
sends information to the minds of many Earth people, but is not really 
informed of the truth himself. We must be careful with his information, 
since he still uses the tactics of the Bafath by appealing to those who are 
seeking a god to worship. Using the same methods as his former leaders, 
he will quire often control Earth people by pretending that Jesus is with him 
in his ship and is working for Earth. This is very unfortunate, for many 
people of Earth prefer to believe in the teachings of Jesus, and they are 
being led astray by the deceptive teachings of Ashtar. There are too many 


incidents of ETs easily taking advantage of the mind-set here on Earth. 

 

Who Are the Blue Race? 

There is a blue-skinned race of people, who for many years have kept o 
themselves and lived in subterranean cities. This race has two underground 
cities, one in France and one in Asia, and rarely come to the surface. They 
have been seen on many occasions in India. They are very peaceful and 
pose no threat to our society, for they are not interested in us except for 
the fact that we may cause the destruction of the planet. 

 

What Is the Destroyer Comet? 

In ancient Lyran history they speak of a Destroyer Comet that care 
through their system and wiped out a large percentage of the population. 
This was a great setback to their civilization. That same comet led the 
Pleiadians into our system around 226,000 years ago. On several 
occasions, the comet had a dramatic effect on our planet. Earth was 
disturbed by the comet passing by too closely 10,215 years ago, parting 
the waters of the Atlantic Ocean in the area where Atlantis had been. 
Again, 10,079 years o (8104 B.C.), the comet passed by Earth and caused 
what is known as the Biblical Flood. At that time, the Earth day was 40 
hours long. Egypt was flooded and covered with water for many years, 
forcing the inhabitants to hide under the Great Pyramid. 

On two other occasions, 5984 B.C. and 4930 B.C., the comet caused 
tremendous storms on Earth. The cycles of the comet are rather erratic 
and unpredictable to a point. Sometimes it will come as quickly as 478 
years and sometimes as long as 683 years, but always the average 
appearance figures out to be every 575 1/2 years, which is very unusual 


and puzzling to the Pleiadians. It is when the cycle is closer to the 575 
1/2 year that it passes the closest to the planet Earth. It is expected that 
the comet may return again in 2255 A.D. 

The Great Comet passed by Earth about 3,500 years ago, once again 
creating a terrible storm in the Mediterranean and bringing the sleeping 
volcano of Santorini to life. Located on the island now called Thera, just 
60 miles north of Crete, the great volcano erupted with a terrible force, 
causing a 200-foot-high tidal wave that rolled over Crete, Egypt, and 
Syria. At the time Crete was called Minoa; her people were the 
descendants of the Atlanteans. Many of them fled to safety as their 
homes went under water. Minoa remains standing today, but the island of 
Small Atlantis, which was situated close to the great volcano, slipped 
beneath the ocean and disappeared forever. The last passage was in 
1680, which again caused great damage in the Mediterranean area. 

 

Where Did the Moon Come From? 

Millions of years ago our moon was a fragment of a destroyed planet in 
another system. It was caught by the immense power of the Destroyer 
Comet and pulled into our system. The moon was part of a planet that is 
4.5 million years older than the Earth. Theories that the moon was once 
part of the Earth can easily be dispelled by an examination of the minerals 
found there, which date back farther than any on Earth. 

 

How Many People on Earth Are in Contact with the Pleiadians? 

In 1975 the Pleiadians stated that there are over 17,422 people on Earth 
in contact with Pleiadians. These are not physical contacts, even though 
there may be some isolated cases where they have had brief physical 


contacts. These contacts are the result of transmissions by the Pleiadians 
that can be picked up by Earth people. It is quite common to receive 
thought or ideas during sleep or daydreaming. It is part of the Pleiadian 
morality to not ever let the receiving party be aware of the origin of 
transmissions, for they feel this is interfering with our free will and our 
right to evolve on our own. It is also part of their decision not to interfere 
with a developing species. It should be noted that this information was 
given to us in 1975. I feel strongly that since then, many people may be 
aware of the origins of the transmissions and may even be in contact 
physically. 

For those who are aware of their contact with the Pleiadians, only a few 
come to the public with their ideas. As we are advancing more into the 
New Age, perhaps more will feel the need to help out by going public with 
what they are learning. In nonphysical contacts it is very easy to mix your 
own ideas, wishes, fears, and dreams with transmitted data. The human 
mind is capable of manufacturing almost anything, so great care and 
personal integrity must be exercised before relaying any information you 
may have to the public. 

Sometimes special people may be contacted for specific tasks that the 
Pleiadians have in mind. It should be noted that none of those chosen are 
in any way connected with the government, for this is directly against 
Pleiadian laws. 


Where Is the Closest Planet to Earth with Human Life? 

There is a human race very similar to our own, located just five light 
years from Earth on a planet called Akart by the Pleiadians. Technically, 
they are only around 117 years ahead of us and are in the first stages of 


development of space flight. 

They have visited Earth on several occasions from a space station that 
they have out in free space. Even though they have developed space 
flight, they have not yet advanced to the point of breaking through to 
hyperspace. This means they cannot travel in time or traverse the huge 
distances of the universe in short periods of time. Even their trips to Earth 
take several years. 

They suffer from bodily pain when they travel in space, and they use 
drugs to help overcome this problem. Their ships are not yet equipped 
with energy-protection screens of the type that can shield them from 
special radiations that penetrate their ships. 

They mostly come to Earth for food, taking with them seeds, plants, 
water, and other staples of life that they may need. Their home world is 
greatly overpopulated and supports over twenty-three billion people. Here 
on Earth we have built our population up from around 1.5 billion to over 
5.4 billion people, just in the last one hundred years. Are we headed for 
the same problem of overpopulation that may send us out into space for 
food? 

 

When Will Earth Have Open Contact with ETs? 

The Pleiadians have been watching and observing our progress as a 
society and have indicated that they may instigate an open contact for the 
people of Earth. This may be done around the year 2000 A.D. with a race 
of beings not so different from ourselves. If this plan for contact comes to 
fruition, we will be contacted by radio and informed that they are 
approaching Earth and will be here in several months. At first there may be 
a lot of panic and fear, for we will have no idea who they are or why they 


are coming here. The thought of beings from another world strikes fear 
into the hearts of many people on Earth. 

After several more radio transmissions, people will begin to calm down and 
get used to the idea. Continued transmission will explain that they look 
similar to us, but have no hair; their bodies are thinner and taller, but with 
hands and feet like we have. They will arrive in a ship which is very large, 
white in color and oval-shaped, something like a large egg. The landing will 
be in America, for they will have ascertained that here people will be mere 
receptive and less prone to panic and fear. It is not known for sure if the 
Pleiadians will continue to encourage this contact. As we approach the year 
2000 A.D., we can only wait and hope for the first radio transmission. 


Did the Atom Bomb Dropped on Nagasaki and Hiroshima Have Any 
Lasting Effects on the Planet? 

August 6th, 1945 saw the end of World War II between the Japanese and 
the United States due to an atomic bomb which was dropped on Hiroshima, 
followed a few days later by another atomic bomb over Nagasaki. These 
blasts have had several lasting effects on the planet. 

To begin with, the explosions had a very small, almost undetectable effect 
on the rotation of the planet. It has also affected the normal orbit of the 
planet around the sun. 

Scientists have no idea of the far-reaching effects that these two actions 
will have on the planet. The magnetic poles of the planet have been shifted 
and continue to rotate. The North Pole has already moved into the 
Canadian Sea, and in 1,000 years it will be located on the western coast of 
Saudi Arabia at a point between Dschidda at the Red Sea and the Islamic 
town called Mecca. The South Pole is likewise shifting and is heading 


toward South America. The effects of these changes are not recognizable 
yet, except for some minor changes in weather, but over the long haul the 
entire planet will have been affected, since entire continents will become 
uninhabitable as the weather changes. All of the oceans will be affected, 
and millions of people will have to move out of Europe as it slowly becomes 
the ice-covered North Pole. In Russia, scientists have already discovered 
the shift in the poles and have properly calculated the direction of the shift 
and the effects on the planet. 

At the time of the explosions, large amounts of very high frequency 
radiations were unleashed, which are having disastrous effects on the 
ozone belt around the planet. This is not normal electrical energy, but 
radiation energy detectable in the ultraviolet field that is currently unknown 
to the scientists of Earth. This radiation normally mixes with the oxygen in 
the air and generates ozone. Normally 500,000 parts of air has only 1 
part of ozone, but after the explosion, the ozone value increased 34 times 
for a short time, which amounted to 28 parts. Just after the blast, the 
ozone values decreased very fast. The consequence is that this imbalance 
will destroy the microorganisms, which are of enormous importance to the 
preservation of all Earthly life. This effect will last for hundreds of years.

By the year 3000 the North Pole will be located in Saudi Arabia near the 
city of Mecca. 

 

The Story of St. Germain 

The man known as St. Germain was born under the star sign of Aries into 
the family of Rakoczi in the year 1711 in Collonia, known today as Koln, in 
West Germany. He had the title of Count St. Germain. 

He became friendly with a power group called the Rosicrucian’s, who were 
interested in his ability to influence people of power, such as kings and 
nobles. Since he was a man of few morals or scruples, he began to work 
for the Rosicrucian’s in order to gain control and power. Using illusion and 


deception that was not understood by many of his time, he could easily of 
his followers into believing he was a man of great magic who could live 
for thousands of years. Being particularly good at magic and alchemy, it 
was easy to beguile the simple minds of the people of his time. 

St. Germain never became a member of the Rosicrucian’s, although he 
claimed to have attained the high ranking of a member of the Seventh 
Beam, which means he would have been an Initiated One. In actuality, he 
was nothing more than a sleight-of-hand artist who was good with 
chemicals, which allowed him to produce a glare-gold, using certain 
chemicals on metal. 

He would hypnotize women of importance and get their secrets, then wake 
them up and tell them what he knew about them, causing them to marvel 
at his supposed abilities. They had no idea that they were being hypnotized 
and used so easily. He would even convince some people that he could 
become invisible, since the people of the time had no idea of the power of 
hypnosis over the conscious mind. 

To further enhance his image, he claimed to have traveled to China, which 
was not true. He actually only went to Berlin to report to the Rosicrucian’s. 
This was a splinter group, for the main group was in Vienna. The 
Rosicrucian’s used alchemy to make him look younger so that people would 
believe that he was really timeless and would live forever. After his death 
at the age of 73, the Rosicrucians found people who looked like him and 
altered their faces to keep the myth going. The Pleiadians tracked down his 
spirit, and found that the man who was known as St. Germain is currently 
reincarnated and is living in Germany. 

 

Are There Any Pleiadians Working with Our Government? 


According to the Pleiadians in 1975, no government is in contact with ETs 
on a regular basis, and there are no Pleiadians working in government 
positions. To begin with, the Pleiadians, as well as most other races that 
come to Earth, have no authority to interfere with the political or power 
structures on Earth. The alliance of planets that they belong to forbids this. 
They have a policy of noninterference as long as the inhabitants of a planet 
are not technically advanced enough to leave their own solar system. 
There are, of course, some races that come to Earth or pass by who do not 
belong to this alliance, but they have no interest in the affairs of our 
planet, and they would be discouraged by the Pleiadians and other races 
anyway. 

The Pleiadians do not interfere or work with any governments. If they did, 
there would be no need for secrecy. Their Mission is to help the beings of 
the planet, not individual organizations, self-appointed governments, or 
political leaders. Also, if they were involved with governments, the military 
would not be so busy hunting for their Beamships. 

It has been almost 20 years since the Pleiadians commented on this, and 
things are different today since the American, Russian, English, and other 
governments have all come in contact with ETs from different systems. It is 
unfortunate that none of them, except the Belgian government, have 
decided to share what is going on with the public; but the time is rapidly 
approaching when the secret can no longer be kept, as thousands of 
people all over the planet are having contacts of their own, and the truth is 
coming out. 

 

Do any Earth Governments Have Beamships? 

As far as the Beamships are concerned, several Earth governments have 


been working on their development for many years. These are not really 
Beamships like the Pleiadians have developed, but they are equipped with 
explosion-type motors, or with a kind of drive system that has a thrust 
effect. The first ship of this type was developed in February of 1941 in 
Germany under orders from Adolf Hitler. The first flight of the craft 
attained altitudes of over 40,000 feet, with speeds of over 1,200 miles per 
hour. If the Germans had been able to perfect these craft and get them 
into the air, they would have made a decisive difference in the outcome of 
the war. 

At the end of World War II, the ship was destroyed so that it would not fall 
into the hands of the enemies, although some of the plans for certain parts 
of the ship were taken, and other governments started work on these 
flying discs after the war and still continue today. The test flights of those 
flying discs are sometimes seen by individuals who believe they are looking 
at extraterrestrial craft, and are not aware that they are manmade. 

The size of the Earth-made ships is normally 300 feet in diameter, and 
they do not fly very well. They cannot leave the atmosphere and are 
confined to low altitudes on Earth; in some cases emergency landings have 
been made because of faulty equipment. This has been a serious health 
problem in some cases, since many of the craft now being developed use 
atomic power and give off radiation which is harmful to those who come in 
close contact to it. In events where this has happened, the pilots of these 
craft usually seize any witnesses and threaten them with harm if they 
should tell anyone of the incident. Or they will say they are from other 
worlds, and pretend to be extraterrestrials that will kidnap the witnesses 
and take them away if they speak about what they have seen. Since most 
Earth people can be so easily controlled by fear, this method has worked 
well to keep their secret, and there are many Earth beings that are quick to 


believe that extraterrestrials are visiting Earth and would gladly go along 
with this story. 

While there are certain evil-minded extraterrestrials that do come to Earth 
and occasionally kidnap Earth beings for study and experimentation, most 
of the kidnappings are by Earth craft, using the people for their own 
devices and study. Certainly most of the sightings and observations 
reported are of Earth craft. It is very unfortunate that men of Earth have 
such little respect and love for each other, for there are many cases where 
Earth craft have pretended to be sent by God or that they are angels on a 
mission, then exercise control over Earth beings to do their will or perform 
certain tasks for them. In some cases the makers of these Earthly craft 
have tries to control public knowledge this way, by telling the Earth 
contactees that they are ETs and giving them information to tell the public 
that is not true. This is most common with religious messages. Since the 
Earthman is so easily controlled by the "message of God," it is easy to 
make him believe that he is having contact with God's own messengers, or 
that Jesus is onboard the craft, and has chosen them to speak for him. This 
is very unfortunate, since the well-meaning Earth contactee does not know 
any better and is being used by his fellow man. 

There is also no truth to the story that the Pleiadians or any other race 
have come to save the Earth and create peace. This is probably the most 
harmful thing to tell people, since it only builds up false hopes and serves 
to enslave the thinking of Earth people even more by making them think 
that someone else is going to save them or create the long-awaited peace, 
while they do nothing to create it themselves. The Pleiadians, as well as all 
other races that they are in contact with regarding Earth, would never do 
this, for it is not their responsibility to control the future of any race. They 
care about us like distant relatives because we have common ancestry, and 


they love us as they do all creatures of Creation, but they will not solve our 
problems or control our destiny. We must follow our own path and take 
100% responsibility for ourselves and our world. It can work no other way. 

 

Life Forms in Our Universe 

Here on Earth there is probably no bigger question than whether or not 
there is life on other worlds. It challenges our belief systems and poses the 
deep question, "Are we alone?" It is probably a good idea that we have not 
been exposed to the answer yet, for until we reach a stage of development 
where we can live in harmony and use the technology necessary to get 
there with responsibility, we probably wouldn't properly understand what 
we would see anyway. The possibilities for societies of different morals, 
philosophies, and customs are endless; as yet we have not even been able 
to get along with our neighbors here on Earth who merely look, dress, or 
speak differently. So, as in all things, we need to take one step at a time 
and get our own house in order before we go visiting someone else. 

Pleiadian science, along with information that they have learned through 
their contacts with other races, can give us a picture of the development of 
human life throughout the universe. The planet Earth was one of 
40,353,607 planets that naturally developed the human life form during 
the course of its evolution. As billions of years of evolution went by and 
race after nice developed and spread out into the universe, proliferation of 
the human form began. Currently in our galaxy alone, it is estimated that 
there are over 7,500,000,000 planets that support various forms of human 
life. The Pleiadians have come in contact with 1,800,000 of them and 
found 343 different variations of the human form. The differences come in 
the number of fingers, eyes, skin color, height, etc., but all are erect 


homosapiens as we would classify them on Earth. As we move out into 
free space and explore, we will begin to come into contact with some of 
these races and will discover there is a large family of man extending to 
the depths of the universe. 

 

Future Visions and Pleiadian Prophecy 

Billy's home, the Semjase Silver Star Center, is located up in the hills 
among beautiful, rolling countryside with deep valleys filled with clouds 
that mist the beautiful vegetation, making everything seem fresh and alive. 
Taking walks in the forest around the Center was a particularly enjoyable 
pastime for me. There is a little road that passes by the Center and leads 
off into the woods where I could easily be alone for as long as I desired. 

Large trees and lush shrubbery filled with nature's little creatures lend to 
the magical feeling that permeates the Swiss air. I had a couple of places 
that I liked to go that weren't too far into the woods, but distant enough to 
feel alone. My favorite time for forest-sitting was late in the afternoon as 
the sun was starting to go down. The sunlight would be breaking through 
the all trees and creating dancing lights that frolicked across the ground 
like small children playing. I often spent an hour or two sitting in this 
beautiful, serene place, just bonding with all that was around me. 

I had been at the Center for a couple of months, and my head was filled 
with new ideas for my mind to assimilate. Here in the forest was a great 
place to be at peace and commune with nature while working out man of 
the questions I had. Billy, Bruni, Silvano, and many of the other members 
of the F.I.G.U. had all been very kind to me over the past few weeks and 
shared with me their hearts and their minds. I was very thankful, and I 
had a lot to think about. 


One of the really nice things about a forest is the great energy that it 
contains. It's a wonderful place for personal reflection because the energy 
of nature helps you raise your consciousness and spiritually bond with the 
universe. I was very interested in connecting with the future to see how 
the knowledge of what I was learning would fit into the world. The 
Pleiadians had made such an effort to bring us knowledge in so many 
areas, and I had to think that the future could be changed for the better. 

Visions of the future, daydreams, and unexplained flashes of ideas were 
common to me, as I always welcomed information from different realms. 
As a child, I learned how to open myself up to seeing future events. I 
believed the future was being created by the present, and we could foresee 
what we were creating if we so desired. To me a future vision was 
nothing more than a glimpse of what my spirit was planning for my 
material self to do, and I always enjoyed watching. 

My times in the Swiss forest helped me work out the meaning of what I 
was learning about the coming times of change for man on Earth. 
Besides, something rather peculiar was happening within myself. I was 
having vivid daytime dreams and visions that seemed to deal with what 
I was learning. I was very drawn to the history data. Somehow it 
seemed a little familiar, but not like I had been there. It just seemed to 
make a lot of sense to me, as if I had already known about it. My 
feelings were getting stronger all the time about my attachment to the 
Pleiadian Mission. Bruni had suggested that perhaps I was of Lyran 
descent and had come to Earth many thousands of years ago as a 
rather violent warrior. Possibly this was all true, as my visions were all 
very strong and vivid and seemed to occur in real time, which is 
indicative of future or past visions. They weren't fleeting daydreams of 
ideas or feelings, but real time remembrances, like I was there living 


the moment. Sometimes they would last for several days, like a movie 
running in the background while I was doing other things. 

I was using a routine of mental exercises to cause these visions that I 
had learned when I was a kid. It was a game I would play with my 
mind that would allow me to turn off the physical world and tune into 
other realms of consciousness. The game was my own invention and is 
a little childish, but it does produce results. It was certainly working for 
me with the Pleiadian material, for I was doing more remembering than 
I was learning. Almost everything I would read from Billy's Contact 
Notes was easy to understand, as if I had known it before and was 
being reminded. Even the concepts of space travel and the structure of 
the universe seemed like things I had known before but had somehow 
just forgotten. None of the concepts seemed difficult or profound, but 
instead had a very strong ring of truth about them and were serving to 
open up my mind. I was enjoying a frenzy of learning and awareness. 

I would find myself a comfortable spot in the woods out behind the 
Center and spend a few minutes relaxing and enjoying the scenery. My 
mind would start to wander and become attached to the trees, the 
wind, the flowers, or whatever was around. I would begin to lose 
awareness of my conscious, physical self and slip into a waking-dream 
state of observation I begin with taking three deep breaths very slowly, 
holding each one in for a moment and then releasing the air very 
slowly. This served to calm the body down and begin the focus of 
attention on the breath, which is directly connected to the life force. My 
attention to breath got me in touch with my life force as it flowed in 
and out of me. After taking the deep breaths I would feel a calmness 
and tranquility come over me, which allowed me to begin the move from 
my conscious mind to my subconscious. 


During my stay in Switzerland, I used the routine that I developed when I 
was a kid since it had always worked for me. I used it to tune into when I 
was learning. Here's how it works. It is my intention to let my mind go 
traveling without any interference from my physical self. I assume the role 
of an observer, like viewing a movie. I see myself walking into a small 
movie theater with just a few seats. I sit down in the middle seat of the 
front row. I'm the only person in the theater; it's very dark and quiet, just 
like a normal movie house. When I sit down, I notice that the movie screen 
is very large and white. It's only a few feet in front of me, and there is a 
large red knob just below the screen that turns it on. I have programmed 
myself over the years to know that once I turn the red knob, the movie will 
start, and I can observe whatever is playing that day. Sometimes I will just 
turn the screen on and watch whatever comes on, or maybe I will want to 
continue a movie I have seen before, or perhaps I want to know something 
from the past or future, it's all there. 

There is a brief pause as I tell myself very firmly, "Now, I will turn the red 
knob which will start the movie, and no other thoughts may come into my 
mind." I put myself in the role of an observer, who may only watch end not 
participate. This is very important because if I allow any of my own 
thoughts to come in or influence the movie, the information cannot be 
trusted. I have also discovered that if I interject my own thoughts into the 
movie, they will usually be thoughts that are wishful thinking, desire, fear, 
or ego from my conscious mind. The movie screen must become a source 
of information to be observed only. I take a brief pause to get ready, and 
then reach forward and turn the red knob. Now I sit back and enjoy the 
show. 

Once the knob is turned and I'm in the observation mode, all attention is 
on the screen. No other thoughts are allowed. If I feel a thought creep in, I 


order it out immediately. It's important that I have strong discipline with 
myself if this is to work. The process of putting myself in an observation 
mode with no outside thoughts is very rewarding, for my subconscious an 
then connect to outside knowledge of the past and future and creates a 
movie for me that I have never seen. If I let my own thoughts come in, it 
becomes daydreaming and wish-fulfillment, and that's not what I'm after. 

The screen is usually blank for a minute or two, but I keep my 
concentration on it with no thoughts. The trick is to go blank and wait. I 
just concentrate on the white screen, with no expectations or involvement. 
Soon the screen will start talking to me in sound and pictures, the movie is 
beginning. At first it may just be a flash of light or a passing image. 
Whenever something starts, I make sure I'm watching with that same 
feeling that I have when I watch a movie for the first time. I don't know 
what is going to happen next, I am just an observer and I am not going to 
get involved. If I make no attempt to add any thoughts or direction of 
my own I'm in for a pleasant experience of creative thought. 

As the movie begins to show itself, it may not be recognizable at first, 
especially if I ask myself to see something in particular, like a past life 
or a future vision. But I remain in my observation mode and things get 
better. It's very exciting as I realize that I am seeing things for the first 
time. My subconscious mind is actually creating images for me and 
drawing information from different sources including my past, my 
future, and my higher and older self, other life forms could also be 
sending me an impression or two. 

In my case, I was interested in the Pleiadian information, so I 
preprogrammed myself to see anything in connection to the Pleiadian 
contacts. I was happy to find many new images relating to my 
childhood dreams of the great, white-haired warrior who seemed so 


familiar. I had related these dreams to Billy and Bruni and was told 
these were the images of ancient Lyran warriors. These dreams were 
common when I was a kid, and I had never made any connection to 
what they might mean. But here in the woods of Switzerland I was once 
again back in ancient times, somewhere on a far-away world, fighting 
great battles with high technology. I was very tall, around 15 feet. My 
body was thin, but well-muscled. My long, white hair hung halfway 
down my back and served as a flag to the men who followed me, for I 
was always on the front line leading the charge. I could feel an attitude 
of invincibility as I pushed forward with no fear. My arms were covered 
with bracelets of technology that obeyed my mental commands, firing 
tremendous weapons of destruction. I moved forward slowly, burning 
the air and ground in front of me as another world fell under my attack. 
Overhead were the large, flying warships that would soon land once my 
men had taken control of the situation. There had been many worlds 
succumbing to the forces of my power. I led the way for my race to 
dominate hundreds of worlds and control the galaxy. 

Childish dreams, perhaps. But my movies tell the story of ancient Lyra 
all too well. Forty years before I had ever heard of the Pleiadian 
contacts or read Billy's notes, I had already seen much of the Lyran 
history without knowing it was connected to Lyra. Here in the Swiss 
forest, my daydreams were connected to a past that lay deep inside of 
me somewhere. I had dreamed all of these thoughts years ago when I 
was little and they were still with me, but more vibrant and in-depth 
than ever before. 

I returned to the forest whenever I could to create more movies. The 
more I did this, the more in-depth the movies would become. They 
were serving as a teaching mechanism to allow me to work out new 


ideas and concepts that I was learning. I could play them out here on 
my movie screen as real experiences. It was very stimulating when the 
movie was so vivid and so many things come to me from out of nowhere. 
Many of my movies were seeing Billy having contacts with the Pleiadians in 
their Beamships. I world feel like I was eavesdropping on their 
conversations, and sometimes wondered if I was really there. Quite often I 
would be concerned that Billy and Semjase might be able to sense my 
presence. Sometimes it seemed so real that I thought I might be able to 
join in the conversation. 

On several occasions I would get direct images from the Pleiadians in the 
form of thoughts or ideas, which would encompass entire concepts or ideas 
for me to think about. The fact that I was keeping my own input out of the 
movies made it exciting for I was sure the ideas were coming from a 
source other than myself. The Contact Notes were starting to feel more 
and more like experiences that I had lived or experienced before. I felt no 
connection to the Pleiadians themselves; I have never had the idea that I 
may have live on a Pleiadian world or actually had any physical contact 
with them. It was just that the stories, ideas, and concepts that they talked 
about all seemed so familiar. I must have had some involvement at some 
level somewhere in the past for all of this to seem so real and easy to 
understand. 

 

The Future Movie 

Since I was very interested in the future, many of the movies I would 
create were about the events that were going to happen on Earth. Some of 
the more interesting ones were about events I saw happening over the 
next 20 to 50 years. Here are some of the future visions that I have had. 


Community 

The problems of running America will become too much for the 
government. They will not be able to maintain control much longer. Small 
communities will appear in rural areas that refuse to follow the federal 
system. They will make their own rules, for survival reasons. These 
communities will produce new inventions in energy and health control that 
have been suppressed for years. A community system of barter will spring 
up, as well as the issuance of new community money that becomes the 
denomination for this new culture. New forms of local government will be 
invented that really are "government by the people, for the people." 

Politics 

The end of more than 200 years of American politics is just around the 
corner. I see politicians fleeing the cities and even the country as 
Washington is overrun by angry mobs. An attempt will be made to use 
international troops to hold off the angry mobs, but it won't work, and the 
government will fall. A new Constitution will have to be created so the 
people feel like a new day is coming. Scandal will rock the country as the 
public discovers how the rich have bankrupted America and taken the 
money abroad. Several rich and powerful people will be killed in public by 
angry and outraged citizens. A secret room will be discovered under the 
White House that will expose how the American people have been lied to 
over the years. It will contain the secrets of how John Wilkes Booth 
escaped after killing President Lincoln. Other secrets involving World War 
II, President Kennedy, and George Washington will be discovered and 
brought to the public. 

Flooding 

A tidal wave will hit southern California and wash over Long Beach. The 


wave will be several hundred feet high and will extend completely out into 
the desert, leaving Palm Springs under water. A new waterway will be 
formed from the Salton Sea all the way to San Diego. Most of the water 
will recede and leave Los Angeles covered in mud and debris. Those who 
survive the flood will try to save the city and begin to clean it up. This is a 
bad idea because after they clean it up, the city will be hit again by 
earthquakes. 


War with Aliens 

There will be a steady increase in the sightings of alien spacecraft, so many 
that the government can no longer hide it. There will be a mass sighting 
near a military base, and the American Air Force will shoot down one of the 
alien craft. The ETs will react and wipe out most of our air bases all across 
the country. People will be screaming in the night as large, round alien 
craft will be floating over the cities of America. Many people will disappear. 
The alien activity will not last very long because peaceful ET's like the 
Pleiadians will run them off. 

 

The Islands of California 

Over the next 30 years a series of floods and earthquakes may leave the 
southern half of California split up into several islands. The disaster will 
come at a time when the fragmented American government cannot help. 
Southern California will decide to leave the Union and be the first state to 
become its own Republic once again. It will soon be joined by the northern 
part of the state, and the California flag will fly over its new capitol in a 
small town somewhere east of San Francisco. The new Republic of 
California will flourish once it is on its own. New breakthroughs in energy, 


communications, and health will be manufactured in the new Los Angeles, 
built in the Mojave Desert. These products will provide free energy for man 
and eliminate disease and increase the life expectancy to more than 150 
years. News of these breakthroughs will spread around the planet and 
change the way we live on Earth. This new Republic will be the role 
model for a new generation who will be the leaders of Earth by the year 
2050. 

 

Uncovering Ancient Cities 

Ancient cities under the ocean will be uncovered that existed over 
10,000 years ago. Written documents about our history will be 
discovered, as well as drawings and plans for weapons that were used 
at the time of Atlantis In Egypt they will discover more underground 
rooms under the Sphinx, containing treasures and information that will 
tell us about life on Earth for the past 12,000 years, causing 
anthropology to be rewritten. Giant tunnels will be found in South 
America, leading to still-inhabited cities which are thousands of years 
old. 

 

The End of New York 

New York City is hit with a series of disasters, beginning with more 
terrorist attacks that ruin the subway system. Earthquakes in the 
Atlantic will cause flooding that will roll over Manhattan Island, Queens, 
and Brooklyn. The city will be underwater and will have to be 
abandoned. Its ruins will stand for years, since there is no way to 
reclaim the land. The tops of the Empire State Building and some of the 
other skyscrapers will still be sticking out of the water and will become 


small cities for the homeless, who live by sailing small boats to shore 
for food. 

 

Accidents in the Sky with Technology 

During testing of high defense systems in orbit around Earth, there will 
be an accident that will ignite the air, causing the fire to be seen for 
thousands of miles. The atmosphere will be burned and unbreathable 
for years. The infected air will float around the planet, causing major 
loss of life and many new diseases. Other countries will rise up in anger 
at the apparent stupidity of the U.S. military. 

 

The Food Goes Bad 

The oxygen content of our atmosphere gets so low that our food no 
longer has much nutritional value to it. People will survive off of food 
grown underground or in water. The process of photosynthesis will 
become so weak that trees and plants cannot make enough oxygen to 
keep us healthy. New diseases will flourish that we cannot fight, and 
people will be left to die where they fall because everyone is afraid to 
touch them. The oceans will become lifeless pools of death and cease to 
supply us the oxygen we need. Panic will break out as millions starve 
and kill each other over food. 

 

Underground Cities 

Governments and military will hide out in the huge underground cities 
that they have been building for years. Their plan is to ride out the 
difficult times and take over the surface later. This plan backfires as 


earthquakes destroy most of the cities. It is discovered that the "secret 
government" has been covertly building cities on Mars for years, but that 
has backfired and almost everyone there is dead. 

 

Giant Space Platform 

Once California becomes a Republic, science flourishes under the new 
leadership, and they launch a huge space city in orbit around Earth. By 
the year 2030, thousands will live there in an effort to make sure the 
human race survives. It is eventually decided to use the great power of 
the space city to stop the many wars that rage on Earth. The new 
government of America is still failing, and Europe is ruined. Peace comes 
to man finally, and everyone agrees to let the Space City become the new 
government of Earth, for they have the technology to survive. No one 
argues because they have no choice. 

 

Contact with Peaceful Aliens 

Around 2050, when man has survived and is rebuilding his society, we will 
make peaceful contact with other ETs like the Pleiadians. We will then be 
a planet of higher consciousness guided by spirit and love, and will 
continue our move into the New Age. The old paradigms of military and 
politics are gone forever and only exist in the history books. 

Conclusion 

I would remind you that these future visions are only my own and do not 
reflect the prophecy of the Pleiadians. All of these visions were seen 
by me and are more logical than they are prophetic. I would encourage 
you to practice the process that I use and connect yourself to the future 


and see for yourself. The future is only what we create it to be, so ask for 
enlightenment, and answer how you can contribute something useful to 
the transition our civilization is in. 

 

Prophecy and Predictions 

During the three years that Billy was in contact with the Pleiadians, they 
put him in touch with highly advanced beings of consciousness that 
transmitted to him prophecies about coming events on Earth. Some of the 
prophecies are from conversations, and some are received in symbol form 
through spiritual telepathy. Billy also created several predictions himself 
that are the result of his own calculations. The transmissions from ETs and 
higher spiritual levels have turned out to be more accurate. Billy received 
them in a spiritual language of symbols and then translated them into our 
language. 

Before going any further, let me explain something about prophecy and 
predictions that Billy taught me. There is a difference between a prediction, 
created through the use of numeric calculations, and a prophecy, which is 
a vision of the future created by one event leading to another that has 
originated from a certain point. 

Predictions are future events, which are computed with cabalistic 
calculations that lead to very exacting results. Correctly done predictions 
come to pass with absolute accuracy, for they are based on established 
fact and proceed to a certain effect that must take place. 

Prophecies are different, though, and are generally a warning function, 
only showing the end effect which would result from certain facts if no 
change was initiated in time. If there is no change, then the prophecy 
becomes a prediction and will surely come to pass. Prophecy is also 


variable according to the free will of man, and so consequently is not 
nearly as accurate as a prediction. Therefore, it is not certain that a 
prophesied event will take place, since it will always come out a little 
different because of the intervention of man. This means that prophecy 
only demonstrates one possibility, and generally is nothing more than a 
warning. 

When it comes to prophecy involving specific people, you must be very 
careful. Prophecies should never be clearly revealed to an individual 
because then they will make changes in their actions to avoid certain 
events, causing their evolution to be faulty. This means that a person's 
evolution must happen without any knowledge of prophetic events so that 
their evolution will run its course naturally. Also, certain events of a 
prophecy must be kept secret so as to not cause fear, hate, or disfavor, 
etc. Those who offer prophecy should be careful because their knowledge 
of events may be inaccurate, causing unnecessary fear and distress for the 
individual. 

In the case of prophecy for individuals, certain information within the 
prophecy should be vague, so the person receiving the prophetic 
information will have to struggle to understand it. Billy does not make any 
attempt to explain the prophecies in any more detail, for he believes only a 
person who can understand the truth himself when it is given to him in 
hidden form is able to bear and tolerate the consequences of the 
knowledge. Just as the stomach can only digest digestible foods, the 
human understanding can only take in and comprehend that which is 
digestible; otherwise, it is overpowered and becomes insane or delirious. 

Remember, the future is not fixed, but is only a projection from a fixed 
point. The purpose of future predictions is to warn us of the future we 
are causing to happen; it does not have to happen this way. Once we 


quit waiting for someone else to create our future for us, once we stop 
relying on a god, a myth, or some religious leader to save us and learn 
to take 100% responsibility for ourselves and our future, we can create 
the kind of peace we all want. It won't come any other way. 

We all have the ability to create our own future. 

 

Pleiadian Prophecy 

The following section is prophecy based on information given to Billy by 
the Pleiadians and other highly advanced spiritual beings for the people 
purchased by writing to Billy in Switzerland. 

President Reagan 

The Pleiadians said that President Reagan would be the man who 
through his deeds will accomplish everything in a way that will cause 
the old prophecies of the Bible to come to pass, and bring us closer to 
the next war. He will be too aggressive and bent on solving everything 
through military force and rearmament. Remember, these forecasts 
were made and documented in 1975. President Clinton may well be the 
last president elected in our normal manner. 

 

The Volcano Vesuvius 

In Italy the volcano Vesuvius will erupt. This event will be a signal that 
the Third World War is imminent and hard to avert. The eruption will be 
caused by all of the negative energy in Rome. Nowhere else on the 
planet is there as much negative and hostile energy as there is in the 
Vatican state. The Earth people should know that even though the 
papacy talks of peace, they have been the major cause of death and 


suffering on the planet for two thousand years. Even though the 
volcano Vesuvius is closer to Naples, the main activity of the volcano is 
very deep under the city of Rome. 

The Antichrist Already Lives 

Billy first reminded me that the prophecies of the Bible are like any 
other future vision and are not fixed events. Prophecy of the future can 
be changed and never actually happens exactly as it is predicted, so it 
is only a projection based on events that are happening at the time the 
prophecy is made. A prophecy is only a harbinger of things that could 
happen. It is meant to warn man, giving him the opportunity to do 
something to change the future so that the prophecy does not happen. 
This is why prophecies are usually always negative events; they are the 
ones that need to be changed In the case of the Antichrist, the problem 
is that man is doing nothing to control his future or change the events 
of the future, so the Biblical prophecy till has a very high probability of 
happening. 

To begin with, the man who will be known as the Antichrist will be born 
to a devoted woman of God in an inconspicuous place around sunrise, 
during the seventh hour, and brought to the East where he is to nearly 
starved to death. He will be saved and taken in by an evil one who 
knows who he really is. 

He will come into his own personal power at the age of 11, and 
surround himself with like-minded people for the next eight years. At 
first it will appear as if he is a follower of Jesus Christ, but he will soon 
place himself above God. His reign of terror will last for 27 years, at a 
loss of 2/3 of the life on our planet. 

During the 27 years of war, most of Europe will perish and many new 


diseases, caused by the decaying bodies, will flourish. We will see the 
end of the British Empire as we know it, and China will invade and take 
over India. 

As the Antichrist invades Italy, the Pope will go into hiding for years, 
and Christianity all but disappears. He will be the 266th Pope and will 
be the last one. The Antichrist will not be responsible for causing the 
war, but will be a spokesperson for an organization that is. All of the 
names he will be called and his organization will numerically be 
connected to the numbers of 666. 

Billy then closed his comments by telling me that the world 
organization that will be involved with the Antichrist has something to 
do with the initials W.U.V. This is not an acronym for the name of the 
organization, but it has something to do with it. I have never figured 
out what these initials mean. By the way, Billy also commented that the 
Antichrist is alive now. So our future is racing towards us and will 
probably occur just as the prophecies predict if we do not do something 
about it. 

 

Natural Disasters 

Volcanoes such as we have never seen, from the very core of the 
planet, will erupt and fill our atmosphere with smoke and debris, 
making it very difficult to live in many parts of the planet. Deep in the 
Peruvian jungles, giant warriors, who were the old enemies of the 
Incas, will appear from their hiding place, a deep tunnel in the Earth. 
They have been living underground for thousands of years, but will 
surface and raid villages for food and then hide back in their 
underground tunnels. 


In Peru there will be a severe earthquake in Udine from deep within 
the Earth's core. America and its islands are areas named as suffering 
from the great smoke from the planet's core. There will be great fires 
in Japan, Arabia, China, and India. The prophecies state that much of 
the earth quake activity is caused by our atomic explosions and the 
robbing of the planet of oil and gases. There are many of us who are 
aware of how we are ruining our planet and must make an even 
greater effort to motivate others to do their part to save our planet 
before it's too late. If we are to avert some of the planetary disasters, 
we must stop the underground testing and the robbing of our natural 
resources. 

Large tidal waves will sweep over the east coast of America and cause 
tremendous loss of life. The waves will continue across the Atlantic 
and roll over England, plunging deep into northern Europe before they 
stop. This is one of the main reasons Billy lives high up in the hills. 

 

The Great California Earthquake 

Not all of the events of the future were predictions or prophecy. On 
March 18, 1978, Billy was brought aboard a Pleiadian Beamship by the 
base commander, Quetzal, for the purpose of fulfilling a request from 
Billy to see some events in the future. Quetzal had consented and 
arranged for a special Beamship that was capable of moving in time. 
The normal Beamships do not have this ability, so he had to obtain a 
suitable craft that was capable of taking Billy on this excursion. 

Once onboard the Beamship, Billy asked Quetzal to take him into the 
future to see the next great earthquake in California. He had never 
before seen an event like this while it was happening, and was very 


anxious to watch. 

After setting some instruments, Quetzal informed him that they would 
leave immediately for a future time in California. The Beamship that 
they were in would be able to make the shift in time and put them in a 
position so that Billy could see the event take place. Quetzal warned, 
though, that they would only be able to stay in the future for about 30 
minutes. He gave no explanation for this, and Billy didn't press for one 
since his interest in science was minimal. 

The Pleiadian craft left the Earth and instantaneously was high above 
the planet, leaving Earth looking as small as a basketball. Then, just 
as quickly as it had left, the craft zipped back down to the surface. As 
they raced back into the atmosphere, the spacecraft had moved 
several years into the future to a time around the end of the 20th 
century. It is not possible to know the exact date, and it would not 
make any difference anyway, because it would be inaccurate. The 
earthquake had been traced to a specific time through the use of what is 
called an event clock, a technology that follows the pat of events to a 
certain point in time. If they returned here every day, the date of the 
earthquake would be slightly different each time, for the future is not a 
fixed thing, but merely a projection of events based on the present and 
affected by the free will of man. 

As the Beamship moved down close to the ground, it was explained that 
they were in California somewhere over the San Andreas Fault line, and 
the earthquake would start in just a few minutes. They were about 180 
miles south of San Francisco when the earthquake started. At first the 
ground started moving slightly, and then with a jolt, it seemed to split 
and break apart. There was a tremendous noise as the fault line looked 
like a snake writhing across the ground. The quake would be greater than 


any in current history and would take a great toll on California. To the 
south the city of San Diego would suffer from flooding, but it would 
survive. On the other hand, San Francisco would be hardest hit, 
sustaining greater damage. 

The Beamship moved to a point southeast of San Francisco where the 
quake was still shaking the ground. Most of the city was on fire and 
covered with a blanket of smoke. The Golden Gate Bridge was broken in 
half and was lying in the water. The Transamerica Building was the tallest 
building standing, and it was broken in half. Most of the city was in 
rubble, with a tremendous loss of life. Since the 30 minutes was almost 
used up, it was time me to leave. The great amount of destruction was 
devastating. 

 

Remember, nothing is ever as bad as it seems. 

 

The Death of Semjase 

At the Center there is a hallway off of the kitchen that leads to a large 
bathroom/shower for those working at the farm. On the wall is a color 
drawing of Semjase walking away from her ship to meet Billy. It's not a 
real picture, but a beautiful lifelike representation created by artist Jim 
Nichol. I stopped to look at it every day, and let my mind ruminate a 
little on what it would have been like to have been there. 

To Billy it is a very important picture, for it reminds him of the lady 
from the Pleiades who had such an impact on his life. He had spent 
almost two years of his life meeting with her and working out the 
problems of getting the Pleiadian message out to the public. I had 


heard several rumors that she had died or was killed as her ship flew 
into a sun. Something has happened that caused the Pleiadians to end 
the contacts, and I was curious to know if Billy felt like talking about it. 
When I brought it up, he told me the whole, sad story of how one 
small, accidental event had changed the course of events of the 
Pleiadian Mission. 

The Story of Semjase 

Billy said that his contacts with Semjase had started in January of 
1975, and that they had continued almost weekly for about two years. 
Most of these meetings with the off-world visitor had been inside of her 
Beamship hovering somewhere in the Swiss mountains. On their ninety-
fourth contact, however, she had come to Billy's home for a meeting 
that would have significant impact on future events for both of them. 

It was December 15th, 1977 on a cold, snowy night, and Billy was 
entertaining Semjase in the meditation room, located just about thirty 
meters from the main farmhouse. The family and resident F.I.G.U. 
members were all gathered around the kitchen table discussing how 
exciting it was that Semjase was so close by. Perhaps they might even 
be lucky enough to see her leaving, or better yet, maybe there would 
be a chance to meet her. After all, she had allowed most of them to see 
her ship on one occasion or another, so the idea of meeting her at last 
didn't seem too far-fetched. Hanging on the wall was their schedule for 
meditation, which listed the names of all the members. But no one 
would be using the meditation room tonight. 

Jakobus was sitting quietly, keeping his thoughts to himself. Billy had 
told all of them that Semjase was coming tonight and to stay clear of 


the meditation room so as to not make her uncomfortable. Her senses 
were quite good and she would probably be able to detect anyone 
nosing around the little building. Her Beamship was hovering 
somewhere directly above the Center, shielded from view by the energy 
screens. Jakobus couldn't help wondering what she really looked like in 
person. Billy had, of course, described her to everyone. He had even 
taken a picture of her once, but as forced to promise Semjase that he 
would not show it to anyone. Jakobus was just thinking to himself, 
what's the big deal, what harm could it cause to just peek through the 
window and have a look? He wasn't thinking of barging in or anything, 
he just wanted to see the mysterious lady from the Pleiades. 

The meditation room was very comfortable, as you might imagine from 
its name. It was an important place on the farm because it was the 
center for all of the F.I.G.U. members to meet in. It had become a 
monument to the rising consciousness of this little group as they 
studied the lessons given to them by Semjase. Most all of them had 
participated in the building of the room and could imagine just where 
she would probably be sitting, right next to the little space heater which 
warmed the bone-chilling cold Swiss air. It was a real honor that 
tonight the meditation room was being visited by the very person who 
had inspired it. Her being there somehow gave them all a feeling of 
approval and acceptance. 

Inside of the meditation room Billy and Semjase were very comfortably 
seated. Billy was listening intently. Semjase had met him here on some 
matter of importance that couldn't wait. She was just about to tell Bill 
the purpose of her visit when suddenly she stopped, held very still, and 
looked around as if something was wrong. She thought she heard 


someone knock on the door, and she asked Billy if he heard anything. 
Billy cocked his ear and tried to listen for what she had heard, but could 
detect nothing. He remarked that she must be mistaken, but Semjase 
said she was sure someone was at the door, and she rose to leave. As 
she stood up and moved away from her chair, she accidentally caught 
her foot on the table leg and tripped over the small space heater sitting 
on the floor. Billy quickly turned around in time to see her fall and hit 
her head against the wall, just as her hand had pressed the small 
apparatus around her waist that caused her to dematerialize and return 
to her ship. 

Billy was disturbed by this, and being left alone in the room, he moved 
to the door to see if someone was actually there. Semjase had seemed 
so sure of herself, but he had heard nothing. But there he was—
Jakobus was hiding just outside the door in hopes of catching a glimpse 
of the star lady. Billy was very upset with Jakobus because he had 
embarrassed himself and ruined the meeting. Jakobus said he was sorry, 
he only wanted to have a look, he didn't mean any harm. He had hoped no 
one would detect him, and he could just steal his look and be gone. But 
instead, Semjase was gone. 

It wasn't until two days later that Billy was visited by a worried-looking 
Quetzal, the base commander for the underground complex in Switzerland. 
His pale lime-white expression caused Billy to inquire about his health. But 
it wasn't his health that was on his mind. He asked Billy to explain what 
had happened on the evening of the 15th, when Semjase had been present 
in the meditation room. The manner of his speech and his attitude gave 
Billy a little start; something was wrong, he was sure of it. For two days 
the whole affair it had bothered him. He was concerned about Jakobus 


messing things up, and then there was the nagging feeling that something 
might be wrong with Semjase. He had seen her hit her head on the wall, 
but then she still dematerialized and returned to her ship. 

Billy did the best he could to recount the evening to Quetzal. He told him 
how Jakobus had hidden outside the door, hoping to see Semjase, and that 
she had become alarmed and left the room. As he was explaining how he 
had seen her hit her head against the wall, a sudden wave of anxiety came 
over him because now he knew why Quetzal had such a sick look on his 
face. Semjase must have been hurt much worse than he had thought. This 
would explain why he hadn't heard from her for two days after leaving so 
quickly. She had come to talk about something important; it only made 
sense that she would have contacted him soon afterward. 

Quetzal had been waiting for Semjase to return to the base two nights 
ago; for he knew she was having a meeting with Billy in the meditation 
room. He was the base commander and watched over Semjase like she 
was his own child. When she didn't come back or send a message, he had 
gone looking for her, only to discover her lying in her ship, which was still 
hovering undetected above the farm. She had a broken arm and a heavy 
fracture at the base of her skull. She was in a coma and close to death. 
Quetzal immediately transported her body into his ship and took off for 
their home planet of Erra for medical attention. She had been lying in her 
ship for hours with serious brain damage, and was still seven hours away 
from help on her home planet in the Pleiades. 

Upon arriving on Erra, Semjase was taken directly to their scientists who, 
unfortunately, could do nothing. There was too much damage to the brain, 
and she had been without medical help for many hours. They had done 
their best to take out the damaged brain tissue, but were powerless to do 


anymore. 

Once her situation had been stabilized, Semjase was frozen. Her father 
Ptaah had made a desperate call to their friend, Asket, who was the 
representative for a highly evolved race of beings called Timers, who were 
from a neighboring universe the Pleiadians referred to as the Dal 
Universe. Technically, they were far more advanced than the Pleiadians, 
and might have a way of saving her that was beyond the science of Erra. It 
was soon discovered that Asket and her people could not do anything 
either, but encouraged everyone to not give up. They had an idea that 
might work to save Semjase's life. There was a race of people called 
Sonas, who had an understanding of life far beyond Asket's people. If they 
could somehow get in touch with them, perhaps they could come to her 
aid. 

Asket was successful and within a short time, several beings called Sonas 
suddenly appeared in the medical room on Erra where Semjase's body lay. 
They had not traveled by ship, but just seemed to appear, as if they had 
projected themselves across the far reaches of a universe by the sheer 
power of their own minds. Their medical methods were unusual, to say the 
least, for they offered no explanations and set to work immediately, 
needing no help from the scientists of Erra. After making sure the dead 
parts of Semjase's brain had been removed, they took the frozen brain 
acids from her body and inserted it into some kind of artificially produced 
plasma proton that they had brought with them. This was put inside of her 
skull, which was then closed up. 

Within minutes, Semjase returned to consciousness with no memory of the 
last 42 hours or of what had happened to her. She simply opened her eyes 
and brought a sigh of relief to everyone in the room, and the life force 


raced through her body and let everyone know that she was going to be all 
right. Semjase was back from the dead, and the men from Sona 
disappeared as quietly as they had come, returning to their home world 
somewhere far off in another universe. 

It was a week, a very long week for Billy, before he once again heard from 
Quetzal. He had been informed by the Pleiadians that Semjase was dead, 
but he somehow wasn't going to feel comfortable until he heard it from 
Quetzal. He waited patiently at the location that he had been led to by the 
telepathic impulses from Quetzal, and watched for the familiar silver disk 
that would soon dash out of the sky. Soon he noticed the birds begin to 
rustle in the trees and take flight, and within a few moments his old friend 
from the Pleiades had arrived, it was sort of like a family reunion. 

Quetzal quickly reassured Billy that Semjase was well. He apologized for 
taking a whole week to make it back to Earth, but he was delayed from the 
many things that he had to do in consequence of Semjase's accident. One 
of these was the replacement for Semjase at the base in Switzerland. This 
would be a man named Isados, who would be here for about six or seven 
months helping out. He was unfamiliar with Earth and with the work that 
Semjase was doing with Billy, so it had been decided that Billy would not 
have any contacts with him and that he, Quetzal, and two ladies names 
Menara and Pleja would continue on with the task of instructing Billy until 
such time as Semjase might again be ready to take up her duties. This 
change would cause some problems for Billy, for he had been working with 
Semjase on several problems concerning certain members of the group. 
This would now come to a halt because Quetzal had no knowledge of these 
things. Billy was even more let down to find out that when Semjase did 
return, she probably would not be able to resume all of her duties, for part 


of her recovery was to take it easy and not challenge her brain too much. 
She would need some time for the implanted plasma to heal the brain, and 
she was to rest and relax as much as possible. It had been decided that 
she should not engage in any work that would be too mentally challenging. 
Even though the Soneans were very advanced, the transformation of the 
artificial protoplasm would take three or four years before it would become 
a natural part of her brain. 

The brain is the central steering of the human, and because of this, the 
brain needs attendance and a special energy supply. This energy supply is 
the cosmic-electrical energy of life that nourishes and feeds the brain 
material as well as the spirit. It should be made clear that this life force 
provides nourishment, but no impulses for healing or regeneration. 
Because of this, if the brain becomes sick or hurt, it is not capable of 
regenerating or healing itself. Semjase's brain now contained the artificial 
plasma put there by the Soneans, which restored the use of her brain and 
allowed the life force to flow once again through her. Part of the 
programming of this artificial plasma was to heal the brain by transforming 
the plasma into real brain matter that will be accepted by the cosmic 
electrical life force, becoming part of her natural brain material within three 
to four years before the body rejects the foreign material. A rather 
amazing feat of engineering indeed. 

Until this tragic event, the Pleiadians had no knowledge of the existence of 
the Soneans, so little was known except these few details which they had 
learned in the past few days. The Soneans are from the Dal Universe, 
which is adjacent to our universe. Their average life span is around 2,360 
years. They grow to be about 68 inches tall and have skulls approximately 
50% greater in size than our own. The name Sonas comes from some 


language which was completely unknown, and their spiritual development 
is 4,000 years in advance of the Pleiadians. Their knowledge of time and 
space was quite impressive, too, for they were able to project themselves 
through the universe without the need of flight machines, utilizing only the 
force of their minds. This really impressed Quetzal, for this was far beyond 
anything the Pleiadians were capable of. 

The recent demonstration of the Sonean's ability to control the flow of the 
cosmic life force and to heal Semjase's brain brought up the idea that they 
might be able to live forever, but even though this may be possible or 
several thousand years, at some point the material body can last no longer 
and gives up. The spirit will run out of energy and go to sleep, causing the 
individual to fall into the death cycle. It is a natural part of the Creational 
logic, dictating that the spirit must have its sleep at some point in order to 
regain its energy and cogitate what it has experienced throughout the 
material life, adding those experiences to the accumulated wisdom that will 
be carried forward to the next life. It is unnatural for man to tamper with 
its process beyond a certain point. 

The prognosis for Semjase looked good. She was told to stay home for a 
few months and rest her mind and not engage in new mental challenges. 
Her brain would need time to heal, and it would not be good for her to 
endure any undue stress or anxiety for awhile. Consequently, she would 
not be able to continue her contacts with Billy on Earth. 

This was very sad news for Billy, for he had developed very close feelings 
for Semjase over the years, and felt responsible for her accident because 
of Jakobus. He had been trying so hard to control all of the egos, jealousy, 
and petty arguments that were continually going on among the F.I.G.U. 
members; moreover, he also was a father, contactee, and prophet. But 


many of the members were very headstrong and difficult to deal with. The 
stress on Billy was becoming too much for him, and it showed in his health. 
He was losing too much sleep and letting himself get run down. 

Is It Time to Stop the Contacts? 

The Pleiadian Council had been watching Billy very closely and could see 
that he was having a lot of leadership problems with the F.I.G.U. members 
that were affecting the Mission. Now that Semjase would not be able to 
continue the contacts, they were very concerned that it could be time to 
stop them. They instructed Quetzal to have a meeting with Billy to explain 
the situation. 

It was very difficult for Quetzal to tell Billy that it may be time to stop the 
contacts. He had grown very fond of him and could tell by the look on 
Billy's face that he was hurt. He knew he would miss Billy, and there was 
the problem of the Pleiadian Mission. The Pleiadians had hoped that 
through educating Billy and making their presence known to the public 
through the photos he had taken that they could help change Earth's future 
to a more peaceful and happy outcome. The dark times that would come 
around the turn of this century could be avoided if mass consciousness 
could be affected in the right way, and they were putting their hopes in 
Billy. Now it seemed that most of their work may have been for nothing, 
for Billy had not made the Contact Notes easily accessible to the public. In 
addition, he had not followed through with his promise to give more public 
speeches as he had been asked, and several of the F.I.G.U. members had 
become such a problem that they were jeopardizing the Mission. Things 
were not working out as well as they hoped, and with Semjase out of the 
picture, the prospects for the future did not look very good. 


As Quetzal continued to explain the Pleiadians viewpoint, Billy agreed that 
certain members of the F.I.G.U. who were angry and jealous would have to 
go. Quetzal would help Billy by monitoring the thoughts of these individuals 
in order to help him better understand them. Billy agreed to cut back on 
his work and take care of his health and delegate more responsibility to 
others. The contacts would continue for awhile with Quetzal until tiny found 
out if Semjase could return. 

For the next couple of months things seemed to be going well. Quetzal had 
made suggestions to Billy to ask certain people to leave the F.I.G.U. and to 
change his own work habits. The Pleiadian Council went along with Quetzal 
and left the decision up to him for awhile, but they made it clear that if the 
F.I.G.U. could not get their egos in line, the contacts must stop. 

For Billy and Quetzal things were developing nicely. The relationship 
between the two had developed into a good friendship, and Quetzal had 
taken time for several contacts which were very beneficial to Billy. His 
easy-going manner and rather obvious intellect were proving to be a great 
stimulator for Billy. But not everything was going well. The Council back on 
Erra had been monitoring the thoughts of the F.I.G.U. members and found 
that instead of getting better; the attitudes were deteriorating and 
becoming even more harmful to the Pleiadian Mission. Billy seemed to be 
lacking in leadership abilities, and some of the people in the F.I.G.U. had 
become so emotionally unbalanced that they served no purpose to the 
Mission, and were becoming destructive to themselves. It was on Monday, 
April 10th, 1978, when Quetzal informed Billy that the group was failing 
and future contacts would be limited to telepathic transmissions to Billy 
only. The F.I.G.U. was on probation. If they could not get their thinking 
straightened out, the group would have to be dissolved and could no longer 


take part in the Mission. 

Reunited with Semjase 

It was only a few weeks later on May 20, 1978 that Billy felt the familiar 
presence of Semjase in his thoughts. She and Pleja, her sister, were 
coming to see Billy. She was feeling better and wanted to see her old 
friend whom she missed so much. Billy quickly dropped what he was doing 
and raced out of the house to meet her. She led him to a remote spot not 
far away and picked him up into the ship. Billy was flushed with excitement 
as he saw her again. He had really missed her. But here she was, just as 
before, with that pretty face and long, red hair and that gentle manner that 
always made Billy feel so comfortable and loved. She was back and 
seemed healthy. He was hoping she would never leave. 

Semjase gave Billy a hug that seemed to last forever. It had been five 
months since they had seen each other, and they were making up for it all 
at once. Billy suddenly noticed Pleja was there and broke up the hug to say 
hello. He had not seen her for over a year, when he taught her how to ride 
his moped one afternoon in the forest. Everyone was happy and smiling 
and remarking how nice it was to see each other again. It was a great 
reunion for all of them. 

Semjase had been recuperating for months and seemed healthy enough. 
The Soneans and their technology had seemed to work wonders. Her brain 
was slowly repairing itself and while she had trouble remembering some 
things, she seemed pretty much herself. Life at home had been very 
calming for her and had given her plenty of time to relax and catch up on 
her home life. 

She had spoken with the Pleiadian Council about Billy and the group before 


coming here, for they were concerned about her ability to return to work. 
Unfortunately, she had to inform them that she would not be able to 
continue with the contacts or her other work; the doctors had informed her 
that her brain was healing slower than anticipated, and she should 
continue to take it easy. Billy was sad to hear this because he was hoping 
that she would be able to resume their contacts. Although he was really 
finding a helpful friend in Quetzal, he certainly missed her. 

Once the Council was told that Semjase would not be able to continue, 
they had consulted with Quetzal about the progress of the F.I.G.U. 
members, and were told that things were getting worse. Several of them 
were openly trying to cause Billy trouble. They were making up untrue 
stories about Billy to hurt his feelings and causing other problems that 
rendered the group dysfunctional. None of the F.I.G.U. members were 
taking the spiritual teachings seriously and were questioning Billy's 
authority so much that he had no control anymore. It had been decided 
that the group was on probation for seven months. They would have to 
take their commitment of personal development more seriously and work 
to help Billy, or they would no longer be allowed to help him with the 
Mission. Quetzal would continue having contacts with Billy, but the Contact 
Notes he would write would no longer be available to the members. 

Billy had to agree, things were beyond him. He was very worried an out 
the state of affairs. He had tried his best to help everyone get along, but 
there were some pretty headstrong people in the F.I.G.U., and the 
seriousness of the pressure that was on them to help with the contacts and 
to be responsible for getting the Pleiadian information out to the world was 
proving to be too much for some of them. They had developed elitist 
attitudes, believing that they were better than other people, and fought 


among themselves like cats and dogs. The rivalry over self-importance 
was bringing the whole group down, and the Pleiadians would have no 
more of it. The Mission to help the people of Earth through the 
understanding of higher consciousness could not be accomplished by this 
kind of thinking. 

Breakdown 

The following weeks were very difficult for Billy. He couldn't sleep or get 
any work done. There was so much pressure on him from everyone 
around him that he was unable to think straight. He was beginning to feel 
like he had failed the planet Earth. In his mind he was responsible for the 
future of Earth, and he was letting everyone down. He had tried so hard 
to perform his mission as well as he could, but things were out of control. 
He did not possess the leadership qualities to control the F.I.G.U., and the 
pressure he felt to keep the contacts going was too much for him. 

It was on Monday, July 17th, 1978, while on his way to meet Quetzal for 
a contact, that Billy's health failed him. He was in the forest waiting for 
Quetzal to meet him when suddenly he collapsed and fell to the ground. 
His health had given out, and he was having a nervous breakdown. He 
blanked out, losing consciousness, and lay flat on his back in a small gully 
near the contact site. 

It was just a few minutes before the alert mind of Quetzal picked up on 
Billy's condition and raced to his aid. He was not surprised that Billy had 
collapsed. He had been warning him for weeks to protect his health. Now 
it was too late. Quetzal sensed that Billy was suffering a breakdown of his 
nervous system and quickly brought him up into the ship. 

Billy was still unconscious as Quetzal quickly examined his body and 


internal organs. He was right; Billy was having a nervous breakdown 
caused by exhaustion and anxiety. Fortunately, Pleiadian science is far 
beyond our current understanding, and Quetzal immediately knew what to 
do. As Billy slowly regained consciousness, he looked up at Quetzal, who 
quickly told him not to speak yet, just relax and he would be okay in a 
moment. He was passing some small device over Billy's body which was 
reviving the nervous system and restoring his health. Within minutes Billy 
seemed much better and was able to sit up and talk. He almost felt 
normal. The device had somehow repaired the nervous system and 
balanced the cells of the body, relieving the stress, and pumped energy 
into his body. Billy felt pretty good actually, and wasn't even aware of 
what had happened until it was explained to him. 

Quetzal informed him that he had suffered a nervous breakdown brought 
on by the problems at the Center. It would take 12 to 14 days for the 
nerves to completely regenerate themselves, but he would be okay. 
Quetzal moved his ship close to the Center and materialized Billy's body 
into his own bed so he could relax and get some rest. The highly 
developed consciousness of Quetzal caused Billy to fall into a deep 
sleep without worry and anxiety so his old friend could heal himself. 
Quetzal was very concerned because his was a strong indication that 
Billy could no longer control himself or the F.I.G.U.. 

The Contacts End! 

Once Billy's health had returned, there were only a couple of more 
contacts with Quetzal, and then on Thursday, October 19th, 1978, the 
final meeting took place. There had been 115 contacts so far, and Billy 
had accumulated over 1,800 pages of Contact Notes for the people of 
Earth to learn from. He had done his best, but it had not been good 


enough. He had to agree with the Council that it was time to end the 
contacts. He no longer had the strength to deal with all of the 
problems, and he had not turned out to be a strong enough leader to 
keep the F.I.G.U. in line. Billy left the ship that day for the last time. 
There would be telepathic communications in the future in order to see 
how he was, but the physical contacts for the purpose of education for 
the people of Earth were over. 

 

A New Vision for Earth 

My summer with Billy had opened up my mind to many things. But most 
importantly it made me aware of how we need to work together to create 
our own future. Its one thing for the Pleiadians to come to Earth to help us 
out, but this is our planet and we have to take care of things for ourselves. 

I hope from what I have written in this book, you can find in yourself the 
need to help make the world a better place. We need to do something with 
as of this information. We need to study it and find ways to make it useful 
for our people and our planet. Peace is only going to come to Earth when 
we address the problems of our lives with spiritual understanding. It is 
time for us all to discover the spiritual bonding that connects all living 
things together with the Creation. Once you can feel this bonding, you are 
in touch with power that can change anything. Imagine if, for just one 
hour, everyone on Earth bonded together and allowed their spirits to 
connect in love and understanding. In just that one hour we could solve all 
of the problems that we have. 

This last chapter is for you and me. Perhaps here in the next few pages I 
can spark your thinking, and we can come together and find ways to 


rebuild our world and move into the next century as a peaceful and loving 
planet where we all can live to our fullest potential. Who knows, we might 
even get the neighbors to come and visit. 

Corning Together 

In the Smithsonian Institute in Washington D.C. there is a small glass case 
containing a rock from the moon. Each year millions of people crowd 
around the case and stare at the rock, taking pictures and spending hours 
in conversation about the excitement of outer space. This simple little piece 
of rock is not more than two inches long and looks no different from any 
small stone you would find in your back yard, but it's from the moon and 
carries with it all of the dreams and mystery of the biggest event in our 
history, contact with outer space. 

Those dreams are coming face to face with reality for our contact with the 
Pleiadians provides us with new mind food to deal with. We have been 
given an opportunity to see ourselves through their eyes, a view of Earth 
as we really are, not as we think we are. But what do we do with all of 
these new ideas? How can we integrate what we are learning into our own 
society and help with the transition into the New Age? 

Nothing is more important than to educate the minds of Earth about the 
material and the spiritual realm. People must learn to understand that they 
are more than just physical beings. We must help everyone get in touch 
with their spiritual self and feel the love of Creation. This is the way we will 
break down the material forces of hatred, prejudice, and other forms of 
illogical thinking that put so much stress on our world. For us to make any 
progress in our quest toward a more enlightened planet we must educate 
and wake everyone up to the spiritual side of life, only then can we 


accomplish the transition into the New Age with a level of higher 
consciousness. 

The Pleiadians and other races see us as spiritual beings in material bodies. 
They listen, observe, and study us as spiritual beings. If we are to take our 
place in the family of man throughout the universe, we have to clean up 
our thoughts and create a collective consciousness here on Earth of peace 
and love. If we continue to project thoughts of anger, jealousy, prejudice, 
hate, and other negative feelings, it will not be possible for us to 
communicate with the races of higher consciousness such as the Pleiadian. 
. 

Time is running out for Earth, for our technology is pushing us out into 
space and right into the backyards of other races who are far more 
developed. We won't be able to take our systems of economics, religion, 
education, and government with us, for they will no longer be adequate in 
a more advanced universal community. The Pleiadians tell us that they can 
no longer defend us once we are capable of leaving our system under our 
own power, and that time is rapidly approaching. What are we going to do 
when older advanced races come to Earth who might like to conquer us, 
coerce our leaders into aligning with them for darker purposes, or worse 
yet, wipe us out and take the planet for themselves? 

The Earth will soon have its opportunity to align itself with peaceful races 
like the Pleiadians or with immoral races who would offer power and 
control to a handful of men on Earth to rule us. The people of Earth just 
come together with a common vision in order to make Earth a peaceful and 
loving planet as we move into the New Age. We must overpower the 
greedy few who currently rule the planet with money and power and begin 
the transition from a material society to a more spiritual one. In order to 


do this, we must come together in a state of higher consciousness and 
align the power of our spirits with a common view of a New Vision for 
Earth. By directing the spiritual power of thousands, even millions, of Earth 
people on a common vision, that thought can become a force of energy 
that can charge the world toward peace. 

Meditate on the following peaceful vision of Earth, and put power into it. 
Explain the vision to others and ask them to help out. If enough of us 
concentrate on the vision, our thoughts will create energy and cause the 
material world to give way to our force, and the planet will start to change. 
Remember, always start little things in motion to cause the big things o 
happen. Just like the Creation, which started with a thought and created a 
universe, we can start with a thought and create a new world. Our future is 
up to us! 

The Light workers of the New Age 

Earth is currently a planet of over 170 nations with as many different 
ideologies, philosophies, and social customs. The leaders of the New Age 
must find ways to bring these many different concepts and theories 
together and find the common denominator that will allow us to live 
together in peace. To begin with, we must learn to understand each other 
with an open mind that allows acceptance of other viewpoints, without 
anger and value judgments. 

This is a time of education for Earth. If you find yourself able to share 
knowledge with others who are on a quest of enlightenment, here are 
some suggestions that may help you communicate and be of help to 
others. 

 


A Vision for Earth 

Blue, blue Earth, your light is bright, 

Shining through the Milky Way tonight, 

Sending out a beam of love 

and riding high on a consciousness, of 

living in the Creation way, 

harmony with nature, in every way 

a world of peace where everyone 

can win a dream and love someone. 

And now you've moved through time and space 

to join the family of the human race, 

Your life is rich, your spirit bright 

and now forever you'll live in light. 

 

Find Your Own Truth. Don't ask people to blindly accept your ideas or 
your information. Remind them that one man's knowledge is just another 
man's information. We must all earn knowledge for ourselves by 
experiencing it and making it part of our lives. Guide people to find truth 
for themselves. As questions are asked, try to answer only what is needed 
at the time. It is better for people to start with small bits of information 
and earn the next question through learning. All of life is a school, a 


spiritual experience of learning and growing. Knowledge is most useful if it 
comes at the right time. Try to promote the idea of an open mind, not only 
is it a sign of intelligence, but it is the way to faster and more accurate 
learning. 

Promote Integrity. Acceptance of new ideas comes from respect for 
those who offer them. If you project integrity and sincerity instead of ego 
or vanity, you will not only be of more help to others, but you will feel 
better about yourself. Don't exaggerate or say things to get attention or 
gain importance. Your spirit knows when you are being untruthful, you 
can't lie to yourself. The New Age is an exciting time filled with lots of new 
information and experiences, but we must be careful to be honest with 
each other and ourselves. There is no better way of feeling good about 
yourself than giving freely without expecting anything in return. If you 
want to fill your heart with love, simply give some to another, and it will 
come back to you. 

Role Model. Our heroes in the last century have been captains of industry, 
movie stars, adventurers, athletes, musicians, and war heroes. There have 
been many fine people among those heroes, to be sure. But the attraction 
is usually that we see in these people that which we want for ourselves, a 
role model for how we would like to be. People learn by studying others. In 
happy homes little boys want to be like their dads, and little girls want to 
grow up to be just like their moms. Role-modeling is very important to our 
young and needs to be taken very seriously. In the New Age our heroes 
need to be of a different type. We need role-modeling that projects 
wisdom, integrity, intelligence, and love. Let's use our schools, movies, 
books, and television to create heroes who are rich in values and honesty. 
The very fabric of our society is based on the integrity we instill in our 


young, for they create the future we will live in. 

Project Equality and Universal Love. Not enough can be said about the 
need for Universal Love in our thinking. Learn to see each other as spiritual 
beings on a path of growth and education, and sense the spiritual bonding 
that ties us all together. It is the material side of us that we find so much 
fault with. We are imperfect as material beings, but we are all logical and 
loving as spirits. If we are to eliminate prejudice, hate, and anger, we must 
educate everyone about the real meaning of life and the power of the 
spirit. If you share with each other as spiritual beings, your material heart 
will swell with love for one another. Learn to give of your heart and ask 
nothing in return and you will gain the greatest gift one human can give 
another, the gift of love. 

The Planet. It is time to consider the planet we live with as an equal part 
of Creation. Although it does not have a consciousness as we do, it is 
comprised of particles of matter that have a life force. All matter in the 
universe is composed of energy generated from the evolution of Creation, 
and should be respected as such. Get yourself on good terms with the 
planet and nature. Start by learning more about the planet itself as a 
hobby, you might want to study about the oceans, the forests, or 
volcanoes. Spend an afternoon watching birds build a nest, or sit down by 
a stream and talk to it. There are life forces in nature that you can 
communicate with. Sometimes called elementals, these beings of nature 
will let themselves be seen by humans if you are of the right 
consciousness. You can feel their presence and commune with them. It is a 
good idea to go for a walk every day for about 30 minutes with your shoes 
off. Not only can you feel the planet, but the pressure on the bottoms of 
your feet will stimulate the organs of your body and improve your health. 


This is an age-old practice called reflexology and can be a valuable part of 
your health care, so take a Saturday and lean about it. Keep pieces of rock, 
crystal, plants, and beautiful pictures of each around you. Give them 
names and make them your friends. Live with the planet, not just on it. 

Study Spirit. Study about spiritual consciousness and share it with others. 
Read books, go to conferences, expos, and fill your mind with an inventory 
of information that can help you discover yourself. You might want to join 
or start a study group with others of like mind, and experience and learn 
together. Practice meditation as much as you can, for it's the gateway into 
your spirit and your older/higher self. Through meditation you can develop 
more balanced thinking and make life more enjoyable. You can also try out 
your ideas and learn about the different levels of consciousness and how 
your mind works. Listen to those who have gone before you, and then find 
your own path and develop your own wisdom. Your life is your own journey 
and must be walked alone, but you can use the footsteps of another as a 
guide and make your own discoveries. Get in touch with Creation and 
experience the spiritual bonding that we all share, and your material life 
will be forever easier and more fruitful. Then share it with another! 

Help Educate the Young. At any age we are nothing more than the 
accumulated experiences that have gotten us to where we are now. And 
the experiences of our youth are the formative years that create our 
adulthood. Too many people are having difficulty with adult life because of 
childhood experiences that control their thinking. We must learn to educate 
our young better and eliminate child abuse. More than 50% of the children 
in America today are abused, either mentally or physically, by parents who 
don't love them or understand them. We are creating a nation of unhappy 
people who are not capable of offering anything to anyone else because of 


the hurt they carry around inside of themselves. Spend some time with 
children and help them with your love and understanding. If you can, adopt 
a child or be a big brother. You can certainly donate some time at a local 
park or school. Children respond very well to love and understanding, and 
so will you. 

Be Creative. Creative thinking keeps you young and alert. It stimulates-
your brain and makes your spirit happy. The personal satisfaction that 
comes from being creative is a doorway to sharing your love with others. 
A beautiful picture you paint, a song, or a poem can project the love of you 
spirit to thousands of others and really make the world a better place. Art 
in any form should be promoted for everyone. Make it a regular part of 
your life. It's not important how good you are at it, the satisfaction comes 
from the process of creation, not the adulation of others. Shed the need for 
approval from others, and express yourself in art that brings out your 
unique qualities and helps you understand yourself better. You should at 
least keep your environment filled with music, paintings, beautiful crystals, 
books, and stimulating objects which challenge and stimulate your senses. 
Every now and then buy some object of technology that is beyond your 
present understanding, and just keep it around until you figure it out. It is 
important to teach your mind to constantly be learning and trying to grow 
to new levels of understanding. Remember, life is a school, enroll now! 

Who Speaks for Earth 

As we think, our thoughts move through space. If millions of us combine 
our thoughts, we can communicate with other worlds and develop 
relationships with more advanced beings. In this way we can create 
alliance for Earth with peaceful races. This is very important, for the 
America government, as well as other first and second world nations, are 


all anxious to make connections with other worlds in order to gain power, 
weapons, and control over other nations. The dangerous game of "King on 
the Mountain,' played by the world powers, can lead us to alliances with 
nonhuman race who will offer technology and power in exchange for our 
lives. 

It is already happening in America, as certain "above the law" elements of 
our government have created alliances with a nonhuman race of ETs from 
a twin star system called Zeta Reticuli. It began in 1947 when one of their 
space ships crashed in New Mexico. The bodies of small nonhuman being 
were discovered in the wreckage and gave our government a serious 
problem. Not knowing how to handle the sudden appearance of visitors 
from another world, especially nonhuman ones, and fearful of a panic, they 
decided to keep it quiet. A wise decision at the time, but within a short 
time more ships came and the administration was confronted with having 
to make a deal with these visitors. Our government decided to provide 
bases for the in exchange for technology. 

These small nonhuman beings, which are called Greys, have no emotional 
concern for us, and look at us as lab experiments. The Pleiadians have 
confirmed their existence, stating that they are a highly scientific race, 
more interested in the planet than in us, but on some occasions take Earth 
people for experiments. Over the years many Earth people have been 
contacted by these little Greys, but have learned very little about them. 

Earth is being contacted by the Pleiadians, the Greys, and several other 
races. Millions of people all over the world have seen their ships and have 
had contacts of various kinds. It is no longer a question of whether or not 
they are real, but a question of whether or not you know about them. The 
people of Earth need to make contact with the Pleiadians and other 


peaceful races; then we can be involved in how Earth becomes aligned with 
beings from other worlds. 

I feel that nothing is more important right now than educating everyone 
about their spiritual selves, and creating a large mass of humanity who can 
come together on the higher planes of consciousness and communicate 
with the Pleiadians and other peaceful races. The thoughts of Earth are 
being monitored all the time by many races. If they begin to detect a 
growing mass of people coming together spiritually, I believe they will 
come to our aid. Let's send "Greetings" from the people of Earth, and not 
from any special branch of the government. 

Peace on Earth 

It takes nothing more than watching the evening news to see how much 
trouble we are in as a planet. There are wars raging everywhere. The 
leaders of our planet are making no attempt to create peace because they 
stay in power through turmoil. No government wants to relinquish their 
own authority and blend in with other countries. This is why we have no 
real power in the United Nations. It is up to us, the people, to find a way to 
bring the nations of the world together, in spite of the governments. 

Imagine if we formed a group of spiritually minded people who understand 
and live by the principle of unconditional love, and visited different 
countries around the world. They could go to each major city and put on a 
spiritual education expo, where everyone shares and listens to one another 
and talks about our different customs, philosophies, and ideologies. By 
sharing, we can find the common ground between us and blend our 
heritages together in a common goal for our planet. We can carry the 
message of spiritual bonding all around the world. 


An educated mass of people can do far more than any government. There 
is nothing more powerful than 100 million people with common thinking 
and common goals. Look for ways to communicate and make, this happen. 
You might want to join a computer bulletin board service and make friends 
around the world, it's the modern-day pen pal. Talk to people at embassies 
and send newsletters to organizations in different countries. Record audio 
and video tapes of your ideas and make them available to radio and 
television in other countries. Write, or better yet, read a book about 
another culture. Find ways to communicate and understand people in other 
countries so that we can come together as a planet. People do not have 
trouble getting along, only politicians have that problem. 

 

Its time to educate not legislate 

I want to express my thanks to Billy and his family for extending me their 
courtesy and friendship during my three trips to their home. Even though 
they have endured so many hardships and difficult times over the years, 
they still had time to make me feel welcome. My thanks to Silvano, Bruni, 
Billy, Popi, and the other members of the F.I.G.U. for providing me with 
the spiritual food to help me along the path of my own discovery. 

 

I hope that the information I have made available here in this book has in 
some way contributed to the ongoing efforts of the Pleiadian Mission and is 
of benefit to mankind. 

I have no plans to return to Switzerland, but instead hope that the 
experiences of my travels can be of some benefit to other seekers of truth.

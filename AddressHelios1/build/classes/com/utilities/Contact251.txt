Billy

It is so nice to see you again, my friend. Welcome to my lair.

Ptaah

I, too, am delighted to be able to greet you again, Eduard, my friend. I am supposed to convey to you warm greetings and wishes from everyone - especially from all those people you know personally, but also from some you do not even know.

Billy

Thanks. I do hope that I will keep hearing from them every now and then - from you as well, of course. Now the year 1995 has begun and with it the time of finishing your tasks here on Earth.

Ptaah

That is correct, but it does not signify that we will also end our contacts with you; our intention is that they shall continue, although much less frequently. It may take many months, therefore, perhaps even a year or two, before one of us can visit you again.

Billy

I am certainly pleased about that, because I would really miss all of you very much, especially you, because you were practically the only one in the past few years who visited me. But tell me, when are you people withdrawing all of your crews and materials from our planet?

Ptaah

We have already completed that task, and there is nothing on Earth now that points to our previous existence here, with the exception of the materials in your possession. The last of our people left the Earth approximately 30 minutes ago. Our stations no longer exist either; everything has been restored to the way it looked originally; no trace of our stay here can be found.

Billy

Of course, you had to do that, that's clear. A long time ago Sfath already told me, along with Asket, Semjase and Quetzal, that you people would have to do this once the year 1995 had begun. You, too, told me the same, and I had to promise all of you to keep silent until the time when you would all withdraw from Earth for good. I am familiar with the reason for your withdrawal, but I don't know whether I am allowed to speak of it officially because you told me that it would have to remain a secret for the time being, at least until 1995 when you are all leaving the Earth.

Ptaah

You must continue to keep this secret; do not speak about it under any circumstances. We are only permitted to elaborate to the point as our withdrawal from Earth is linked with the immediate future and related events, in which we are not allowed to interfere in any form so that we may protect and keep close reigns on the secret regarding our own culture and region where we live. This is tied in also with the fact that some matters are impending. On one hand, we were able to foresee them but, on the other hand, they are the reason for our withdrawal, while events that have been unfolding on Earth for several decades now were part of our assignments. We have fulfilled this task, along with the many others we were obligated to look after, and you have played a very important role in this scenario of making public, worldwide, the so-called UFO phenomenon, as terrestrials have labeled it. You alone made it possible to promulgate this subject matter worldwide and provoke the controversy to the extent that it is not only religious and pseudo-esoteric sectarians, fanatics, gullible individuals, madmen, etc., who preoccupy themselves with the subject. Finally, for some time now, a great variety of scientists, governmental agencies, military services and governments have also begun to seriously preoccupy themselves with this subject, a fact that could not have been accomplished without your help and great resulting effort. Actually, alone through your efforts was this successful launching of the worldwide UFO controversy possible, for which we all express our appreciation to you - a recognition you had to really struggle for, when I think of all the harm that came crashing down upon you. And it is irrelevant whether they were health related or associated with the defamations, abusive language, assassination attempts, diatribes of hatred and other things to which we, unfortunately, had to contribute our share, as you know. Had it not been for these occurrences, the UFO controversy would never have come about and scientists, as well as the military and governments, among others, would not have become seriously interested in it. In your defense I am permitted today to speak officially about these matters and the fact that we used special techniques to analyze and evaluate in great detail the movie and photo montages, along with the movie trick photography used by all those bogus and deceitful, purported contactees or UFO observers. We found that their falsified movie and photo material appealed to terrestrial humans, particularly to those so-called UFO experts who call themselves ufologists and the like, and this even includes some well-respected scientists. The absurdity of the falsifications, and the people who believed them, is stunning yet extremely effective. For this reason, we executed maneuvers with our genuinely existing flying objects, e.g., jerky pendulum movements and certain skipping and floating movements, which ordinarily are not a part of our flying objects' normal movements and flight techniques. Instead, they appeared like those ridiculous, abrupt pendulum and strange swaying movements of the manipulated movies and photos by the UFO swindlers, liars and charlatans. The fact that we chose to execute these movement types is based on the reasoning that they, in particular, would result in the worldwide, fierce UFO controversy which resulted in many hardships for you, of course. You were accused of fraud, deceit, charlatanry and, indeed, dishonesty. You were further charged with constructing models and then photographing and filming them. Often we felt very sorry for you, but were unable to change any of this. Only by executing certain flight maneuvers, which you then were able to film, photograph and disseminate throughout the globe, was the worldwide UFO controversy ensured that led to the previously mentioned outcome. In the future, they will also bring about additional and by now urgently needed results. It may be some consolation to you now to know that everything has occurred with the desired and intended outcome, and that you are now the most important person in matters related to contacts with extraterrestrials and UFO affairs - you probably are the most famous personality worldwide in these matters. Of c...

Billy

Excuse me, but I am not conceited because of it and can easily do without that.

Ptaah

Your words and resistance were probably inevitable, but they do show that you really have not changed. But I am not finished speaking: It was inevitable, of course, that people would appear who were jealous of you, and others who defrauded and falsified your film and photo material, because they wanted to make you look preposterous and destroy your work. Therefore, they sought to obtain your original films and negatives, which was not particularly difficult to do because of your trusting attitude. Subsequently, this material was copied and recopied over and over, and also falsified through composites and other manipulations to a point where the appearance of trick photography and photo montages was evoked. These underhanded elements used movie footage and photo negatives that had been retouched or marked with lines to give the impression they were threads, ropes, wires or other such suspension accessories. Then these movies and photos were disseminated worldwide while you were handed back falsified "original films" and "original negatives", without you ever having been suspicious or wary, since you fully trusted those who came to cheat and slander you. Nonetheless, even in the early beginnings of your work, there did exist people who truly trusted you and knew you were neither a swindler nor a charlatan, and that you were honest through and through. These individuals also viewed your movies and photos, and recognized the genuineness of the photographic material and your own truthfulness; they were not dissuaded; they supported and greatly assisted you. Among them were many who also suspected that certain elements of the movie footage and photos were either manipulated and falsified by ill-meaning individuals, or that, for very specific reasons, such things as the strange flight maneuvers of our flying objects had been performed to generate doubt, deliberation and this worldwide UFO controversy. They realized that the strange swaying motion and jerky pendulum movements of our flying objects, which you filmed and photographed, were intentionally produced to trigger a particular response in Man's thinking process. These individuals accepted this fact and refrained from allowing themselves to be influenced by defamatory gripers and others; instead, they stayed by you, or within the close or extended circle of your group, acquaintances and friends.

Billy

Well, that's how it was, and I thank everyone who has always trusted me. But now it probably is time to thoroughly speak of all those matters you people had not allowed me to talk about until your withdrawal was complete.

Ptaah

Of course. Now you can speak about them. The time has come for us to withdraw as planned. New things manifest themselves for human beings on Earth, and a new era ensues, toward which you and we have done so much to ensure that everything transpires as intended. Above all it was you who flattened the most important paths, and together we have performed and executed our duty. This at least fulfills our task, while yours is still ongoing.

Billy

I hope to be able to fulfill my task.

Ptaah

I have no doubts about that.

Billy

Normally I do not give in to doubt, but one never knows what may happen unexpectedly.

Ptaah

That is correct of course.

Billy

Precisely. - Have you studied the 23 typed pages which you picked up three days ago and brought back yesterday? That is actually what I wanted to discuss with you - whether or not they can be talked about now. In my opinion there need be no objection to this, because you are no longer active on Earth. - Oh, yes, what about your activity as Jshwjsh for Earth; is that redundant now that you have completed your task?

Ptaah

Certainly, for I must turn to other assignments now.

Billy

Too bad. So the Earth is without an Jshwjsh now.

Ptaah

That is not quite correct, for there still exist descendants of old "gods" who will make themselves heard. But I am only allowed to report about it to you confidentially, if you are interested.

Billy

By all means - let's do it after our official conversation.

Ptaah

So this is how we shall handle it.

Billy

Now then, let's get back to my 23 pages. Is everything correct?

Ptaah

I did not notice any mistakes, other than typing errors. One thing that was not quite correct, though, was the chronological order of events; but I assume you did this for a purpose so no specific years and other calculations of time could be gleaned from the data. I, for one, find this very sensible. In some places you repeated yourself, for example, when you advanced the time of an event and then repeated it at the proper place.

Billy

Yes, I know that.

Ptaah

Other than that I did not notice anything incorrect.

Billy

That's good. Later, when I write down the report, I will add the 23 pages to the text of our conversation.

Ptaah

That is your prerogative.

Billy

Good.

So, I shall begin with this:

The story about Enoch (Henok in German) or Nokodemion, respectively, is well known within our group; excerpts from it can be found also in the OM. However, nothing was ever mentioned until now about the other things that transpired with Enoch nearly 12 billion years ago with regard to his peoples. Even as far back as Sfath, your people requested that I remain silent until 1995. Later on, this commitment of silence was reconfirmed too by Asket, then Semjase, Quetzal and yourself, Ptaah. Now that 1995 has begun, and you have given me your permission to talk about it, I want to offer my knowledge as I still recollect it:

After the great restitution movements by the peace fightertroops, following the end of the peace wars and peace times between all peoples and planets, Enoch's original tribes split into two lineages. One lineage went its own way to the Lyrian territories, where they settled in another space-time configuration that deviates by a fraction of a second from this, our space-time, configuration. They lived there, but only after they had inhabited other worlds and systems in other alien galactic regions for many billions of years that resulted in wars. Subsequently, tribal emigrations occurred throughout space and ultimately culminated in another space-time configuration that deviates from ours by the fraction of a second. The territory was located in the Lyra star system. For this reason, people continue to speak even to this day of the Lyrian territories and the Old Lyrians who, later on, had to return to our space-time configuration partly for exploration purposes and partly as a method of escape. Consequently, they arrived on Earth and became active in the well-known things I have already mentioned. Up to this point, this lineage retained all knowledge of their earliest origins, and from these earliest origins evolved the Pleiadians, or rather the Plejarans. In their own language they call themselves by the identical name as their star cluster beyond the Pleiades, which is located in another space-time configuration and also deviates from our space-time configuration by a fraction of a second. After breaking away from Enoch's ancient tribes approximately 12 billion years ago, the second lineage, ventured on a totally different route than that of the Lyrian group, if they may be called that. They, too, emigrated into other galaxies. But a mere 7 billion years ago, knowledge of their true, Ur-ancestry (Ur = most ancient origin, primeval) was lost. Today they have absolutely no knowledge of their true heritage. Hence, their chroniclers, historians and others created a different legend about their heritage that had nothing, or very little, in common with their true background any longer. This lineage consisted also of many diverse races, in the same manner as the Lyrian lineage. However, in contrast to the Lyrians, who remained ready to fight at any time and steadily evolved toward an equilibrium from which emerged the peaceloving, well-balanced, highly developed Pleiadians, the second lineage reached that state far too quickly. Consequently, they completely lost their capability to fight and were increasingly defenseless against aggressors. As a result, they joined an extensive emigration of all peoples and landed in the region of the Sirius constellation. Once again they lost all knowledge of their past and their heritage. Again a new Ur-history of their ancestry was assembled and registered into the annals. This lineage spread through the Sirius regions' farthest reaches and continuously evolved to the point where they were capable of creating new life. Having lost the ability to fight, these people bred new human races and manipulated their genes so these new races would be able to fight and protect them from repeated attacks by aggressors. Through invasive genetic manipulations, these new human races were turned into life forms who bore barbaric traits that tended toward degeneration and cruelty, and their life span was limited to approximately 100 years. Their genes were manipulated and tampered with because the creators and overlords feared the beings would band together and annihilate them. Eventually, their fears became reality, and for this reason new methods had to be found to bring the genetically-manipulated races under their control once again, although it meant that these goals would have to be achieved through radical extermination. Since the "creator-overlords" were more powerful than the genetically-manipulated individuals those found but one recourse and that was to flee, which they did with help from benevolent supporters in the Sirius regions. At the same time, these supporters secretly decided to exploit the genetically-manipulated people for their own use. Two large, genetically-manipulated peoples fled from the Sirius regions and settled in an area on the other side of the Sun. This meant they landed within, and then inhabited, a very distant part of a remote solar system; indeed, on planets beyond the galaxy's central sun, the sun of the Milky Way. Eventually, however, they were discovered by space travellers from the Old Lyrian lineage, whereupon they emigrated into the Lyra regions. Ultimately, within more recent terrestrial history, they came to our planet, where they settled in China, Japan and other locations, and various new, so-called races formed. Upon leaving the Sirius regions, the other genetically-manipulated peoples found a way to the SOL System, where several thousands of rebellious genetically-manipulated people had previously been banished to a myriad of terrestrial locations as a punishment. These masses of diverse races found refuge on the planets Mars and Malona/Phaeton, respectively, where they constructed cities, pyramids, stations and other things. They led a good life on Mars until the planet become uninhabitable through cosmic influences. For this reason, the genetically-manipulated people had to leave that planet in ancient times and, subsequently, they settled on Earth. Over the course of time, they became terrestrial human beings whose true and genuine Ur-origin was within the regions and planets of Sirius. Only the pyramids and gigantic monuments on Mars were left behind, abandoned, but stations remained operative for a long time even though all life on the planet had perished. One day all of this will be discovered by terrestrials, the genetically-manipulated people, and some of these sites will even be used once again. Malona, or rather Phaeton, was destroyed in fratricidal wars by its genetically-manipulated inhabitants who had originally come from the Sirius regions, and who blew up the planet by diverting parts of an ocean into the subterranean or underwater magma chambers of a gigantic volcano. The SOL System's Asteroid Belt contains fragments of this former planet, whose orbit was not where the Asteroid Belt is today but was located where Mars orbits the Sun today, and Mars at one time was located where the asteroid belt is today. This position reversal was caused by immense upheavals in which the Destroyer (planet) played an important role. The planetary locations of Mars, Earth and Malona/Phaeton, and solar systems on the other side of our galaxy, in the Milky Way, where the two yellow races settled down, were selected as effective hide-outs by these races' benefactors, who were the conspirators for the escape of the genetically-manipulated people. Throughout the past, the refugees' hide-out locations were kept secret from the "creator-overlords" in fear that once the overlords determined the refugees' location, they would send out punitive expeditions to eliminate the fugitives. This danger remains in existence even today and, consequently, the Americans were extremely careless in sending into space probes revealing data on the Earth's location and descriptions of human beings. If, by chance, this information should fall into the hands of the "creator-overlords", they would learn that the genetically-manipulated people, the terrestrials, somehow had survived and greatly multiplied over these past millions of years, and one would have to assume that attacks upon Earth and its inhabitants would be launched from the Sirius regions. Such actions would result in the terrestrials' total elimination. The benefactors would not rush to aid the terrestrials, for they have withdrawn from our region long ago, shortly after their ventures to Earth, in fact, when they began fearing the genetically-manipulated people, the terrestrials, in much the same way the "creator-overlords" did formerly. This fear, which also gripped the benefactors led to the eradication of the Earth peoples' ancestral records by way of various manipulations. At this time, the benefactors elevated themselves to gods and exalted themselves above the terrestrial population, who rapidly became their vassals and believers. Truthfully, in doing so, the benefactors very soon became the antithesis of benefactors. On one hand they hoped to make the genetically-manipulated people their subjects and that, on the other, many cults, religions, fratricide, family feuds and wars would be launched through this worship of gods, whereby the terrestrials, the genetically-manipulated people, would decimate and exterminate themselves. As a consequence, they, the gods, respectively former benefactors, hoped they would be free from the danger of the aggressive, barbaric terrestrial human life form. This plan went completely awry, however, because terrestrial Man, who had become increasingly stronger, smarter, more barbarian and underhanded, began to enjoy his role and defended it to the last drop of blood with every conceivable means, ancient and modern. Consequently, the genetically-manipulated population, now the inhabitants of Earth, totally slipped from the control of their former benefactors, respectively the gods, who, in turn, withdrew from the terrestrial human beings and from Earth -- but not before swearing revenge and demanding satisfaction in the future from the human population on Earth. For the Old Lyrians, the benefactors' withdrawal paved their way to Earth and its human beings, and as they ventured to Earth on expeditions and in flight after leaving their space and time configuration, they entered our space-time configuration in the SOL System. After a while they, too, comported themselves as gods and began causing havoc. The former benefactors of the genetically-manipulated population had no idea then, nor do they now, that these developments took place nor do they know about the existence of the Pleiadians, respectively the Plejarans. The terrestrial, genetically-manipulated human beings, however, disobeyed the Lyrians and Pleiadian/Plejaran gods as well, although some of these gods attempted to force the terrestrials, such as the Gizeh Intelligences, Ashtar Sheran and the like, under their yoke and domination, using every conceivable means possible. The former benefactors divided into two groups also. One group included those individuals who had sworn vengeance against the terrestrials and later changed their minds, while the other group remained benevolent towards the terrestrials and hoped to one day return to Earth. These "gods" alone from either group know what the future holds in store for us. Should they really return one day, terrestrials cannot expect that anything good will come from those who changed from being benefactors to malevolent personages, for, despite their change into evil-mindedness, they were unable to return to their Ur-habitat in the Sirius regions. Due to their treason they were shunned as outcasts, and now they, too, must take great care to not divulge their whereabouts to the former "creator-overlords" - or they may also become victims of their overlords' curse for revenge. Despite their departure from Earth and the SOL System, these former benefactors, who had become addicted to their passion for revenge, nevertheless continued to maintain some contacts with Earth beings, and occasionally they even visit here. During their contacts and visits they maliciously and falsely influence terrestrial individuals with erroneous messages, visions and similar things, in much the same way the dark elements among the Old Lyrians had done previously. These are only occasional intrigues, however, which only occur, as a rule, in cultlike-religious-sectarian form and are of very little significance, for they usually only affect the Christian religions and not all terrestrial religions. Since their alienation, the two groups, consisting of the former and the current benefactors, have had no contact whatsoever with each other. Indeed, it is very likely that such mutual contacts were strictly forbidden and knowledge of the other group's existence was erased from memory, as Quetzal once assured me according a secret Pleiadian clarification.

Some rather astonishing things are revealed when the genetic manipulations performed by the Sirius-region "creator-overlords" on specific human beings that generated masses of fighters are scrutinized: By way of their evolution, the "creator-overlords" themselves had lost all their capabilities to fight. Their evolution was directed only toward opulence, knowledge, competence and so forth, while their own strength and capability to fight were completely eradicated. Not only did they lose the stamina to fight but the capacity as well. When aggressors approached and threatened to annihilate these highly developed peoples, they had to find a solution to defend themselves against the attackers. To achieve this goal, they begot human beings into whom they implanted, through genetic manipulation, various forms of fighting capabilities along with an aging process factor as a precaution, whereby the genetically-altered people would soon become very old and die prematurely. Such actions prevented the genetically-manipulated individuals from banding together and rising up against the "creator-overlords". This precaution soon proved to hold true, for the genetically-altered people continuously increased in numbers, and they inherited their manipulated genes - for all times. Due to the ever-increasing numbers of these genetically-altered individuals, and their escalating aggressiveness toward the "creator-overlords", these fighters became a growing threat. For this reason, alternate ways of eliminating them were required by the overlords. However, prior to the selection of the most appropriate methods, most of the genetically-altered people were able to flee and, with the help of the benefactors, they found a secure place as I have already explained. The genetically-manipulated people have since established themselves on Earth to the degree where they simultaneously became this planet's rulers and its destroyers, because most of them remained overly entangled in the effects of the manipulated genes of fighting, viciousness, barbarism, bloodthirstyness, greediness, addiction, emotionalism, inhumanities, to name but a few. These characteristics have been an evil legacy for mankind from early times, and they also may actually be called the "original sin". Information regarding the "original sin" was erroneously handed down by Christian religions as the fable of Adam, Eve and the devilish snake in the Garden of Eden. This "original sin", however, the genetic manipulation, repeatedly let the obsession for fighting and evil to surface from time immemorial - almost becoming Evil itself. Yet, in fact, this entire matter is based upon the manipulation of single DNA gene that can be rectified, if only our geneticists were to finally discover it. This genetic manipulation, a characteristic for all living human beings on Earth by way of its inevitable, hereditary transmission, can be reversed and therefore by doing so, Man can finally escape his evil demeanor, which was imposed upon him by way of genetic manipulation. Although science has not yet sufficiently advanced in this field, scientists are nonetheless on the correct path. For this reason alone there is ample justification today for continued progress in genetic research and genetic manipulation, despite objections by those who lack understanding, and others who vehemently reject these concepts and preach idiotic, religious nonsense against things they can neither prevent and nor impede. Terrestrial Man merely has to reverse the former specific genetic manipulation that compels him to resort to bloodshed and murder, bloodthirstiness, hatred, greed, addiction and all other inhumanities. Still, genetic manipulation of the fighting capabilities in the Creation-given Creational law and directive sense must not be reversed since the capability to fight is essential for Man's continued existence and evolution. Consequently, the same event must not occur that previously occurred with the "creator-overlords" who robbed themselves of this fighting capability and lost all of their strength to fight through manipulation of their own genes. For this reason, they were no longer able to defend themselves against any aggressors who attacked them and this, in turn, resulted in their monstrous concept of manipulating human beings so they would become fighting machines through genetic alterations - which, ultimately, precipitated new sets of problems. When the human beings who were genetically-altered into fighting machines by the "creator-overlords" are studied, evidence shows that they procreated, or rather bred specifically for this purpose as they were perfectly normal, indeed, even highly evolved human beings. But they were rudimentarily altered physically through the manipulation of their genes. Prior physical traits reappeared and made these people, among other things, extremely resistant to environmental influences, and they displayed a certain barbarity. Throughout all of these genetic alterations, however, the proponents neglected to manipulate the genetic factor responsible for cognizance, memory, comprehension and compliance with the Creational-natural laws and directives - everything that is balanced and good. This omission was completely intentional, for research had shown that this particular omission would provide a form of security against the genetically-manipulated people's complete degeneration. The omission would always allow a degree of humaneness to surface and influence mankind's lives, actions and other factors, and thus provide some guarantee for the "creator-overlords" that genetically-manipulated individuals would not become viciously assaultive against them. These specific desires were not fulfilled, though, except for the fact that the genetically-altered individuals did not become totally de-humanized or completely, utterly degenerated. From the earliest times therefore, the prevailing factor of stability or goodness, respectively, always penetrated the genetically-altered people's consciousness. Because of this factor over the past millions of years, viciousness has increasingly lost its significance although it remains quite evident, particularly within certain rulers, criminals, despots and others. Unfortunately, no one was previously aware that through the genetic manipulation, and the naturally existing factor of stability and goodness in Man, a conflict or at least a feeling of being torn between opposing emotions would arise. This holds true even today with many human beings. As a result of these genetic manipulations, and from earliest times, Man has fought these inner conflicts of good and evil - where evil frequently is the winner. Nonetheless, increasing numbers of humans combat their way to goodness by conquering the damage done by the genetic manipulation and their wicked legacy, i.e., the evil or original sin. Unfortunately, frequent excesses occur that are based upon degeneration and pseudo-humanism, because humans are unable to find the appropriate paths and cling to false ideals that frequently originated from religious-sectarian idiocy.

Few other details are needed to explain the number of diverse human skin tones on Earth. From our previous explanations, it should now be apparent that various human races and their skin colors originated throughout the most diverse planetary systems of our galaxy, the Milky Way. The regions of Sirius, however, played a specific role too, at least with respect to the actual Ur-Ur-origin, before the Old Lyrians came to Earth where they later merged with terrestrial human beings. Numerous distant descendants from those early days inhabit this planet today. One more explanatory remark regarding the original genetic manipulators: In reality they were the benefactors of the genetically-altered people, hence they were their "creator-overlords". When the time came to eventually kill or merely exile the genetically-altered individuals they (the benefactors) split into two sides. Subsequently, the two divisions fought each other with harsh verbal assaults and accusations until other intelligent beings from the Sirius regions intervened; they were joined by the group who wanted to kill the genetically-altered people. The true benefactors, those opposed to the killing, were able to rescue a great many genetically-manipulated beings whom they had divided into several groups - in spite of the many counter measures of those who wanted to kill. As was previously explained, two groups of peoples settled on the other side of the galaxy, while the remainder of the peoples found new homes in the SOL system on Mars and Malona; subsequently, several thousand degenerate, genetically-altered individuals were deported to Earth. The benefactors knew even then that the people shipped there could not remain in this solar system forever but that sometime later they would have to depart for other destinations. The benefactors were fully aware that this remote system's sun was a waning star even then, and it was specifically selected since the Sirius Intelligences and the "creator-overlords" who were willing to kill the refugees, did not suspect that this region with its dying sun would be a candidate for new settlements of the "degenerates" and "god's workers", as they were called by the "creator-overlords". For this reason, the benefactors placed vast distances between the genetically-manipulated people's home planets in the Sirius regions and the SOL system, as well as the distant system beyond the galaxy, so as to protect those living on them from those who threatened to kill and eliminate them. The selected hideaways were chosen therefore for their extreme remoteness and their position at the fringe of the galaxy. In addition to having a dying sun, another determining facet also was that living conditions on SOL planets, and planets within the system on the other side of the galaxy, were very inhospitable since the breathable air on each of the newly settled planets did not match the original air composition on the home planets. Even on Earth today this is applicable, for its air composition fails to measure up to human respiratory requirements. The dying sun, inadequate living conditions and poor air in the SOL system and beyond the galaxy, were therefore reason enough for seeking hideouts here from the pursuers. The genetically-altered human beings have struggled to survive ever since their arrival in the SOL system so remote from Sirius, its planets and intelligences. The newcomers propagated offspring and ceaselessly evolved as terrestrials. Soon they will have developed the capability to embark into the Universe's vastness and to their Ur-Ur-points of origin. These actions contradict the unjustifiable claims of terrestrial scientists who contend that Man on Earth, in his current form, is the Ur-product of Earth - let alone Charles Darwin's stupid-primitive false premise that Man descended from apes. There do exist, however, some purely terrestrially-created human beings on Earth but they display their own evolutionary lineage, which is independent from the apes, while the apes descended from the original, respectively earliest, human beings. Yet, even these purely Earth-created individuals are saddled with the genetic legacy of the so-called "original sin", if one can call it that. The same applies also to those many humans propagated in former times by Old-Lyrians and Pleiadians who then died on Earth. Every extraterrestrial, absolutely each and every one, who ever lived and died on Earth never again returned to his homeworld. Their spirit forms passed into the terrestrial realms of the Beyond, and they have since incarnated into new human bodies. Because these individuals were born on Earth, they too sustained the damage of the previous genetic alterations by the "creator-overlords" from Sirius. This entire situation transpired because the genetically-manipulated and the purely terrestrial human beings energetically propagated offspring with each other, and as a result the degenerate legacy unrelentingly spread throughout planet Earth's entire humankind.

The genetic manipulations do not imply that terrestrial Man is a born killing machine, but signify only that he is a combative life form, capable of killing when required to do so, or when events trigger his loss of control or outbursts, etc. Such actions may also lead to degeneration; but, generally, they only occur when the two factors consciousness and psyche, hence the person's world of thoughts and feelings, are afflicted or briefly overburdened, whereupon they prompt the act committed in the heat of passion. Therefore, the evil brought about, or rather fostered, by the genetic manipulation, is not an intrinsic, compulsive inborn lust to murder. In truth, the genetic manipulation was only created as a controllable factor enabling Man to subdue the evil implanted in him, and to make it slowly vanish as he walks along his natural, evolutionary path. This takes an incredibly long time, however, and the reversal of the gene manipulation is an absolutely suitable solution therefore. Clearly, there truly exist no born murderers, and this fact must be stated explicitly. Such malevolent predispositions, degenerations, or individual and mass actions result from either injuries of a psychic-conceptual-emotional nature, through some sort of disorder of the consciousness, or by explosive rages. In case of disorder of the psyche or consciousness, organic injuries of the brain can play an important part. All of this is the result only of the degeneration of the gene that was accordingly manipulated, whereby evil, the purely negative, forever forces itself into the foreground. For this reason additional items also come into play, such as Man's savagery and blood frenzy during revolutions and wars, at times when he discovers the ease of killing and then overcomes the killing barrier. Such a barrier normally will remain forever present in Man, despite his genetic manipulation, unless circumvented by disease or explosive rage. Therefore, there is no such thing that Man is born evil in the sense that he or she is totally evil from birth onward, as some people enjoy claiming; those who wish only to see evil and total negativity. Man, of course, was provided with both the negative and the positive from the very beginning of his existence, but not to the point where he is only negative or only positive. Ultimately, an equilibrium is established that truly provides Man with the capability and stability of conquering every inflicting injury and all forms of external influences. Both, negative and positive factors, when combined with and applied to the appropriate form, result in one grand total which turns the human life form into an extremely hardy living entity that possesses the required abilities and is a born fighter for the Creational-natural laws and directives without excessiveness. The "creator-overlords" who originally were human beings with the same characteristics as Man, however, insanely eliminated this gene from within themselves. In the process they lost all their own combativeness and robustness. They modified their entire thinking process and actions accordingly, and this resulted in their complete decadence. Consequently, they were defenseless and were subjugated when aggressors attacked them. As a result they secretly developed this breed of fighters whom they genetically manipulated and covertly new races were propagated having an array of diverse skin colors. These fighters served as pawns against the aggressors and were victorious. Thus, the "creator-overlords" are to blame for their own deterioration. In their distress they procreated a new breed of humans who actually possessed all the nature-given prerequisites once again and, hence, they were capable of fighting and living. This proved to be insufficient for the "creator-overlords", though, and they decided to conduct additional genetic manipulations to make the new peoples even more aggressive than their natural tendencies allowed. To some extent the creators merely amplified certain factors through genetic manipulation, whereby the manipulated individuals actually turned into fighting machines -- but always equipped with the potential capability of normalizing themselves again through the control of evolution. For such an event to transpire millions of years would be required, though, and this evolutionary path continues even today as is evident in terrestrial Man. The genetic manipulations made the negative or evil factors, as humans of Earth know it, particularly forceful and unnaturally aggressive. For this reason these factors have not dissipated from terrestrial Man to the point where they can never flare up again in any way, that is to say, in his excessive procreation of offspring. Such behavior has led to overpopulation, every type of ensuing ill and religious-sectarian insanity and imbecility that is frequently fanatical in character. All of these factors threaten not only the complete, ultimate destruction of the planet, but also the environment in general and every life form. Terrestrial Man's thoughts and actions represent a regressional phase toward the Ur-condition of the genetic manipulation whereby everything degenerates and becomes excessive, just as it did in earliest times. The "creator-overlords", at the time, discerned another reason for eliminating the genetically-manipulated people. This regressive phase is manifested ever more powerful in military action, militant matters or religious-sectarian machinations. Military practices, political hate campaigns, religious-sectarian fanaticism and every type of crime generate a loss of control over the positive, which is consumed and suppressed by the negative. This turmoil spawns a state of negative-evil frenzy, which is then indulged in and pursued without restraint.

In ancient times, men and women were equal regarding their capability and energy to live, fight and do other things. Hence, there was neither a distinction between men and women in those aspects nor in their work sites or types of tasks they performed, although men relieved the physically weaker women at strenuous chores. Women and men were equal in every way without there being any discrimination whatsoever between the sexes, as long as biological differences and related details, which were, of course, considered and observed even in Ur-times. Even then, therefore, women were mainly responsible for maternal duties and household tasks when they were married with offspring. If this did not apply, women performed the identical tasks as the men. Both women and men held government posts; male staff members were incorporated into the team to the extent that men and women always governed in equal numbers and shouldered responsibilities together. Therefore neither one man nor one woman controlled the government. The people themselves possessed the right to speak up and join in the decision making process for all concerns, resolutions, edicts and laws, etc.

As previously explained, the two planets Mars and Malona/Phaeton in the SOL system were suitable for habitation by the refugees, the genetically-manipulated peoples. Planet Earth was still quite inhospitable at the time since its atmosphere was somewhat unhealthy for human life forms from the Sirius regions. Consequently, only those fallible, genetically-manipulated individuals were deported to Earth who had aggressively and viciously risen against their own confederates. Five remnant races fled to Mars from the Sirius regions, while two other races embarked in direction of the sun on the opposite side of the galaxy, as explained previously. The five races fleeing to Mars and Malona/Phaeton were joined by two other creator-overlord races. These two other races had not yet been genetically-manipulated, of course, and had no changes made to their DNAs. They were the benefactors who identified favorably with the genetically-manipulated people, and they assisted them in their escape. Their origins are traced to two different overpopulated planets in the Sirius regions where everyone was prohibited from procreating. As a result, every child born was murdered and the offending parents were sterilized and banished.

The exodus of the genetically-manipulated refugees from the Sirius regions took place over an extended period of many thousands of years, and they were constantly hounded by their pursuers until they finally found an appropriate hideaway in the SOL system, far from their pursuers' reach and sight. A similar fate awaited the other two refugee groups who settled beyond in the galaxy. Indeed, both refugee groups experienced harassment during their many years of flight, which most of them spent in spaceships as they travelled through the galaxy. During their travels revolutions and power struggles broke out and, as a consequence, the genetically-manipulated peoples lost not only all of their previously accumulated knowledge, but also the evidence of their ancestral heritage. Appalling dramas befell them and led to cannibalism throughout all of their spaceships. As a result, the ancestral indications of the genetically-manipulated peoples, the future terrestrial humans, was lost. This knowledge consisted also of information regarding the Creational-natural laws and directives, among other things. Great confusion ensued that led to further problems in face of the knowledge about the dangers of their pursuit; this knowledge was passed down from one generation to the next.

The genetically manipulated peoples, along with their benefactors, the "traitor" "creator-overlords" who eventually settled on Mars and Malona, ultimately developed into a notable technological culture. Unfortunately, they were not able to protect themselves sufficiently and one day were forced to flee from the planets. Their scientists discovered that the SOL system was cosmically much more perilous than they had originally anticipated. Many comets, roaming planets, meteors and other perils repeatedly endangered the two newly inhabited planets Mars and Malona/Phaeton. Several of these space intersectors plunged upon the planets, causing immense damage and taking numerous human lives. In the process, a large roaming planet was discovered that had an unusually long rotation period and an orbit that projected it far beyond the outermost planets of the solar system. According to the astronomers' calculations, this large celestial body threatened to collide with the planet Mars, or to ravage it to a point where all planetary life, including all floral, faunal and human life, would be completely destroyed and annihilated in the wake of a near collision. The genetically-manipulated people, or rather their distant descendants, made the decision to abandon their place of exile. Even these distant descendants were aware of their situation as one of exile, for they remained cognizant of the danger of being pursued, albeit in a much vaguer form. As a result, they were incapable of defining the origin of their peril any longer. The threatening wandering planet in the past, over a long period, had caused a great deal of destruction and wreaked great havoc in the SOL system. According to details formerly presented by Sfath, this celestial body named the "Destroyer" had previously caused the most horrifying destruction on their homeworlds in days gone by, before it streaked through space on its unpredictable course. The "Destroyer" ensconced itself in the SOL system where it also wreaked much havoc. Over time it decreased its orbiting period to an average of 575.5 years; however, the Pleiadians/Plejarans have since increased this interval again. As a result, the "Destroyer" will again appear in the SOL system in about 1180 years. The Pleiadians/Plejarans were unable to completely knock the planet off course, as they had planned; nonetheless, they did change the Destroyer's orbiting period and rotation time in such a way that it presents no longer any danger - at least for the time being. Normally, the planet would have returned in the year 2255 with devastating, destructive results. The High Council failed to give the Pleiadians/Plejarans permission to offset the wandering "Destroyer's" course by any other means or to destroy it, and it requested the Pleiadians/Plejarans refrain from doing so as the Destroyer's obliteration, or a change of its course, would have generated an even greater destruction and possibly even affected the Earth.

As they completed the details for their emigration opportunities, a dispute again erupted among the distant descendants of the genetically-altered people who had, of course, inherited the genetic manipulations from their ancestors. A decisive factor in the erupting disputes proved largely to come from the new teachings presented by the benefactors. The teachings stated that the benefactors were the creators of the genetically-manipulated individuals or, rather, their distant descendants, and that they, the creators, must be awarded absolute obedience and worship. Most benefactors claimed to be the highest exalted beings -- the creators and makers. However, these opinions and demands were not shared by all benefactors and, subsequently, two camps formed: One camp consisted of the purported creators, and the other of those who retained their prevailing benevolent attitude, who distanced themselves from this "creatorism". A dispute resulted not only among these two camps but also among the faithful within the two parties, their followers. Ultimately, the antagonists reached an agreement whereby those who wanted to do so departed from planet Mars in the direction of Earth and Malona. Subsequently, many people from both camps grouped together to emigrate jointly, some of whom travelled to the planet Malona/Phaeton and the others to Earth. The emigration group leader to Malona/Phaeton was called Zenteka, whose wife (Amalaka) concurred with him. The earthbound group also had two emigration leaders who were brothers called Semos and Passas. The atmosphere on Malona was safe and healthy for the emigrants and the peoples already inhabiting it. It was somewhat like the air on Mars and similar to the air the descendants of the genetically-manipulated peoples had become accustomed to over many millennia in their spaceships. Unfortunately, the same could not be said about the air on Earth. Pragmatic modifications were therefore required for future emigrants who wanted to live on Earth. For this reason, the same purposeful adjustments ensued that had previously been effected when the degenerates were exiled to Earth: At that time and before they were deported to Earth, the exiled individuals were forced to adapt to the terrestrial atmosphere, and their skeletal frame required further stabilization, among other things. Those individuals willing to emigrate from Mars to Earth now had to undergo the same remedial procedures so that they would be capable of establishing themselves on this planet.

Everything transpired as the scientists had formerly predicted: The "Destroyer" penetrated the Martian orbit and wrenched Mars with it into another SOL orbit, namely that of Malona, where it remained. Subsequently, Malona drifted away, however, because of the Destroyer's powerful forces, but managed to exist in this orbit until the time when it was destroyed by its inhabitants many millennia later, and became the Asteroid Belt. During this "drifting catastrophe", the inhabitants of Malona were decimated from approximately 470 million humans to barely 14 million; however, they were able to recover somewhat and by the time they destroyed their planet, their population had increased again to approximately 52 million.

The refugees on Earth lost contact with the people on Malona and Mars, which became completely desolate and its remaining inhabitants perished. Individuals from the benefactor group who previously had demanded that they be exalted and worshipped, fiercely spread their false teachings and never again allowed the well-disposed benefactors to gain any power. In this manner, the "creator-overlords" were then capable of putting on the airs of terrestrial Man's creators, rising to power and spreading their insane religious doctrines which, however, contained an absolutely novel yet equally false history of humankind's origin, history and belief. Its purpose was to definitively destroy and lose all data of mankind's true descent in the event that someone else would attempt to secretly glean the information from somewhere. Of course, the true benefactors did not allow this occur. They fought back by inventing their own religious creeds and disseminating them among the now numerous terrestrial human beings. They were hoping that through their new belief system, humans would learn to search for the genuine truth, to grasp and comprehend everything that is truly Creational and natural - and they envisioned their situation turning to the better. To this end, the true benefactors coined the phrase: "The teachings shall be produced for the human beings on Earth, so that they may destroy the impurity and degeneration within their abused bodies." However, in these teachings, as in the teachings by the "creator-overlords", there lay the secret hope that these various philosophies of faith and religious doctrines would form a monumental hindrance, whereby the distant descendants of the genetically-manipulated peoples would limit the size of their population to tolerable and responsible numbers. An alternate motive behind this was that the manipulated people's descendants would neither rise against the "creator-overlords" nor the still benevolent benefactors in order to gain control over them, among other things. The benefactors did not want the descendants to prematurely evolve to the point where the descendants had the capability to fly once more into space with the help of a too rapidly expanding, too highly developed technology, and where they would find their previous homeworlds such as Mars and the planets in the Sirius region. The "creators" also hoped that in their scheme of things, and through their various religious doctrines, the terrestrials would eradicate themselves through the ensuing confusion and wars. They based their hope on the concept that terrestrials would only be technologically, biologically and scientifically capable of conquering space when they had evolved through a sufficiently lengthy period, so as to achieve the mandatory adjustments in their thinking processes and actions. In other words, their intention was that terrestrial human beings, through religious doctrines and diverse religious forms, would have the insight to resolve their genetically-manipulated deterioration problem, whereupon they could correct this deterioration. An important factor in this scenario was that, in the distant future, the terrestrials would discover for themselves the genetically-induced earlier damage imposed upon them, and find their path back to normalcy through appropriate genetic reversals. They believed and hoped that the distant descendants of the genetically-manipulated peoples, the terrestrials, should only then seek contact with their original past, their ancestry, other worlds and human beings in the vastness of the Milky Way, alien galaxies, and the Universe.

Judging from all indications, the terrestrials evolve very quickly on their own, for increasing numbers of people have now been born over a very long period who cherish evolution in every aspect. The benefactors' hopes will be fulfilled and exemplary and peaceable races will come to Earth from the Universe's vastness to maintain contact with terrestrials. This can only take place, though, when the unfortunate chain of genetic manipulation is reversed and normalized in sequential order, and when the human DNAs are Creationally and naturally linked once more to Creation's laws. Preprogramming previously occurred, allowing terrestrials to detect and locate the deplorable genetic manipulation of their DNA chain, although these findings will not transpire for some time. Furthermore, with certainty, this "error", which was imposed upon human beings, will also be reversed by humans themselves. This error has kept Man from living the life of a true human being until this day, and has frequently distanced him from the Creational-natural laws, directives, as well as their fulfillment. For this reason, until now, only a few individuals had the capability to find the correct path, arriving at this point only through the most painstaking struggles to conquer the genetically-manipulated degeneration on their natural course to evolution. Therefore, everything on Earth is directed toward the elimination of what was once genetically manipulated, so that Man can leave the solar system once again before its sun dies and the entire system ceases. This event will occur far sooner than terrestrial scientists currently claim. Truthfully, SOL is already a dying star. And when terrestrials emigrate once again from Earth to adjust themselves to their new home planets, distant and remote from the SOL System, they will have to adapt to those prevailing atmospheric conditions, just as their Ur-Ur-Ur-Ur-ancestors did in the past. The newly encountered conditions will be identical to those of Ur-times, when the genetically-manipulated peoples were breathing salubrious air. As can be stated today, these distant terrestrial descendants will have an extraordinary and agreeable future.

Many years will pass before terrestrial human beings find the proof that their former Ur-Ur-Ur-ancestors came to the SOL system from alien solar and planetary systems to settle on Mars before emigrating to Earth. When they do, the first proof may also be found that mankind's earliest ancestors -- the genetically-manipulated people, or rather their descendants -- were refugees and exiles who originated in the Sirius regions. This proof will shake up the scientific community and, even more so, the religious world; it will prompt the need for great changes. That moment will come chiefly when artifacts from a previous human civilization are found on Mars, with pyramids and sculptures such as the so-called Mars faces representing but a mere fraction of the entire discovery.

The findings and the message to terrestrials regarding the discoveries on Mars will be the factors one day in the collapse of the legendary picture the terrestrials' former ancestors had formed of their heritage. Many negators of the truth will realize with frightening clarity that terrestrial Man did not originate on the planet Earth and, furthermore, he is not the only human life form in the Universe. Although one prophecy states that extraterrestrials will officially land on Earth on June 5th, 1995; a second prophecy predicts this event for 1998. One should probably not count on these occurrences taking place, though, for terrestrial humankind is currently incapable of tolerating such contacts, the ensuing knowledge from them and the related ramifications. Should this event actually take place, the Plejarans would withdraw from Earth and, henceforth, keep their distance from its inhabitants, as Quetzal previously explained some time ago along with Sfath before him in the 40s. One must remember, though, that these prophecies are indeed only prophecies and not predictions. Everything can change, therefore, and the prophecies may not come true unless essential conditions for the events exist. And this is exactly the case - always with the assumption everything occurs precisely and correctly - for its prerequisite is that terrestrial Man must first remedy the damage, or corruption, of his genetic manipulation and change his mentality, thoughts and actions into the Creational-natural state prior to attaining open contact with alien races and peoples, that is, to extraterrestrials. This signifies that a succession of years must still elapse before these prerequisites are fulfilled. Until that time, the Earth and its human inhabitants will experience all forms of events, changes and other things, which are not only essential for Man's evolution but unavoidable as well, because of the terrestrial human life form's thoughts and actions. On one hand, this entire scenario inevitably results in numerous situations which are frequently a grave danger or impediment to Man's evolution. On the other hand, these events are conducive to his evolution and absolutely unavoidable, therefore. Taking everything into account, official contacts with extraterrestrials are currently truly not recommendable, for terrestrial human beings are incapable of bearing the reality appropriately particularly from the secular-sectarian, the military, religious-sectarian, economical and political position. For this reason, official contacts with extraterrestrials would be entirely out of place should they occur at this time or in the near future. Extraterrestrial contacts at this time are viable only with individuals or certain, very small groups; to this end, contacts of a secret military and governmental nature would be feasible as well. Such events, though, will increasingly lead to the public emergence of fraudulent contactees and observers, who present purported photographic material, perfectly falsified with computers. The public will believe them, all the other frauds, deceivers, charlatans, delusional individuals, and those who are capable of mesmerizing many stupid faithful followers in matters concerning extraterrestrials, God, Jesus Christ, Mary and Joseph, Moses and other sundry saints and masters, for Man is too easily deceived and too gullible in his search for truth.

Consequently, contacts with extraterrestrials can only occur on an official level if everything proceeds correctly and Man on Earth is mature enough to accept the contacts. This will still require more time, during which many things will transpire in regard to discovery of proof that human beings on Earth did not originate on this planet, and also that they do not exist alone in the Universe or in this galaxy, the Milky Way. When the events that are yet to transpire before the time when the first official contacts with extraterrestrials take place are considered, a certain chronology of the prospective historic events must be established. To this end, prudence dictates that exact dates not be named, or it might result in conditions that could negatively alter future events. Furthermore, the consciousness of many people could suffer disorders because they might attempt to change things once they learn of coming events - events that cannot be altered in any manner, shape or form, for they are predictions, not revisable prophecies. I will not mention any dates, therefore, although I am familiar with them. For this reason I will simply list, in chronological order, the most important upcoming events, or rather incidents and occurrences, etc., that will take place beginning with 1995. This year will show that nature's catastrophes will continue to wreak endless havoc. Events related to the havoc will increase or decrease in number; in other words, occasionally there will be more of them and sometimes less, but overall the incidents will escalate. Regarding overpopulation, unfortunately, no changes for the better will take place; indeed, overpopulation will escalate. On a broader scale, expect a coup involving the USA and its president, in the year 2003, in march, which will stun the entire world. Additionally, lengthy deliberations will increasingly take place regarding Islamic fundamentalism, which will mesmerize the entire globe. Uprisings, revolutions, wars and other diverse forms of unrest will escalate tremendously, with Islamic fundamentalism playing a very sad part in the scenario. The health of terrestrials is in extreme danger not only from the rapid spread of AIDS, but from the rising ill effects of scrapie among humans, whereby the Creutzfeldt-Jakob-Syndrome is not the only repercussion. The scrapie epidemic will increase among animals as well. And if this is not enough, another horrible epidemic and pneumonia will break out among human beings. Even though efforts are made to the contrary, the renewed threat of chemical warfare, a long-standing practice, will be on the rise once again. Likewise, the same holds true for nuclear and biologic weaponry. The danger of accidents in nuclear reactors will increase throughout the world. Regarding this subject, France in particular must be extraordinarily careful in every way, for one prophecy warns of a strong probability for an accident near Lyon, which can be prevented as long as the responsible individuals undertake the right steps - a prophecy can be changed. Initial efforts are being made by a new movement to promote total non-violence; while a woman gains a high and influential position among world powers through another group's formation. While mass tourism will increase by leaps and bounds, and slowly but surely will invade and destroy the remaining Shangri-Las on Earth, first steps will be taken for a flight to Mars, but will not be blessed with good fortune. However, the next flight, which ensues very soon, will have better luck although it will encounter certain difficulties due to unexpected technical problems. All of this will transpire shortly after the worldwide misery of unemployment and its related ills are corrected and surmounted. A new hording of weapon stockpiles will follow at a time when the worldwide production of weaponry is accelerated once again. This will signal the first threat of a looming third world war, as foretold by a prophecy, unless terrestrial Man strives to avert this danger through reasoning and appropriate thoughts and actions. Should Man fail to act against the fulfillment of this prophecy, a new and extremely destructive weapon will be built that will produce disastrous consequences in the next world war. One important factor in this scenario is the criminal neglect to monitor the Earth from space. New weapons will once again create quite a stir, and so will the death of 4 heads of state who will die within 7 days from each other. These then are the last danger signs, which foretell that within merely 2 years of these events the long-feared world war will indeed erupt, unless terrestrials finally gain mastery over their reasoning to stop all these ills. Should this not be done, mankind will fail in its attempt to protest and boycott the new deadly weapons, because by this time the armories of many nations will be full to their capacity. Passing laws to prohibit the use of these weapons will be ineffective at this late stage. World War III cannot be averted if Man fails to finally become reasonable! The war will begin with conventional weaponry and escalate to nuclear, chemical and biological warfare. The world war will begin in November of a specific year, after 5 years of intensive effort are spent reaching this goal which is preceded by 4 years of unspecified preparations. Should war actually break out, it will last for 3 years and 11 months and will therefore end in October of the fourth year. By this time, Earth's northern hemisphere will be largely destroyed by nuclear fires and radioactive radiation that will annihilate the entire animal and plant world unless Man sees to it that the prophecy proves itself to be just a prophecy without fulfilling itself. Should this not be the case, the world will face some additional 11 bitter years of poverty, misery, starvation and many other ills. The nuclear radiation will cause the crippling and mutation of the children born at that time, and multitudes who survive the war will be contaminated and burned by radiation. Chemical warfare will cause horrifying and atrocious skin diseases, and biological warfare will produce festering sores and many other ills, not to mention vicious human freaks, etc. Prior to these events unfolding, however - always with the assumption that the prophecy fulfills itself through Man's own fault - scientists will discover the manipulated gene from ancient times in the DNA chain responsible for the rapid aging in human beings. These events may yet unfold this year, for preparations in this area began already in 1994. Whether scientists make their discovery public and utilize their findings to their fullest merit is questionable, however. From the way things look now, public disclosures regarding these discoveries will not be made until a much later date, and probably will still remain this way for a very long time before the public will be fully informed about the discovery. Therefore, a long period will pass before the genetic manipulations are reversed by retro-manipulation of the pertinent gene. For the time being, scientists will be unaware that the gene they have stumbled upon is the key factor, and that it is this particular gene which was previously manipulated once before, many millions of years ago.

Should the prophecy of another world war fulfill itself, and should terrestrial humankind not immediately begin rethinking and redirecting its entire effort into beneficial routes, the consequences of this World War III will be cataclysmic. Likewise, this holds true for an enormous revenge-campaign directed against the war precipitators, which will be initiated and directed by a bloodthirsty man, who is - how could it be otherwise? - another "Representative of God", a pope. Once again, these events are based on the condition that the prophecy fulfills itself through the fault of Earth's human beings.

With the melting of the polar caps there also looms for Earth in the not-too-distant future another severe economic crisis that will spread throughout the globe. And another global war, World War IV, will once again threaten this planet and its entire terrestrial population because of their own unreason. However, several reasonable individuals are able to neutralize the threat, which is again abetted by the invention of new weapons with great striking power that will be the materialization of those weapons existing now only in science fiction novels. They are deathray throwers, ray canons, ray rifles and ray guns, among others. In the midst of these developments, three scientists will generate an incredibly inexpensive energy source, although this will not be the only new form of energy, for another will be found as well, that is based on sound vibrations. And again, new and deadly weapons will be developed from this. Scientists tend to utilize everything they can get their hands on, and for this reason it is inevitable that Man will stop the Greenhouse Effect and utilize its effects in reverse, thereby preventing a further melting of the polar caps. These actions, in turn, will lower the highly elevated water levels of all oceans. During this period, terrestrial Man will increasingly dedicate himself to space travel, which he had neglected for many years. Venus will be particularly interesting for terrestrial human beings during this period, and for this reason Man will contemplate sending a manned space capsule to the volcanic planet. Simultaneously, Man will avail himself of a new energy source by exploiting the Earth's interior energies. He will develop two new, dangerous weapons. The first weapon's high-pitched, humanly inaudible sounds will be able to destroy any material and will have the capability of absolutely destroying all life forms ... - an ultrasound weapon in other words. The second weapon will have as its basis high frequency energies which, too, will be capable of destroying and killing everything. Discoveries and inventions in the field of gene technology or gentic manipulation, respectively, will continue, for events must unfold - contrary to the desires of the foes of genetic manipulation who even now persist in ranting and raving against it. The time is no longer that remote when, through genetic manipulations, plants and animals will be successfully cross-bred, and totally new life forms created. Hence, the stupid, antagonistic gripers will scream in vain; they should be grateful instead that science has advanced to a point where genetic manipulations become feasible. For only through genetic manipulations will future rectification of the terrestrials' genetically-manipulated degeneration be guaranteed, so that they may be able to again fit into the normal progression of negative and positive. Creational secrets will, of course, not unravel through this process and will remain a mystery to Man for the time being, even though he will actively search for them while on space stations beyond Earth. This does not signify, however, that science will be inactive; on the contrary. Scientists will unveil the secret of gravitation. In doing so, they will begin mastering certain facets of space and mass. But just before this transpires, terrestrials will develop the capability of allowing human organs to "regrow" for organ transplants. These organs will always be adapted to the particular body in need of the organ. As a result, the danger of organ rejection is eliminated. During this period, renewed advances into outer space will occur, whereby a large space project, critical to mankind, will take shape, and Albert Einstein's theory on relativity will undergo several additional modifications. One religion will initiate large-scale war activities at that time which results in the development and utilization of another new, dangerous weapon that will be capable of changing the climate, a so-called climate weapon. However, as bad as they may seem, these periods are not as unstable as that of 1995, a year when new discoveries on Mars are possible; and a year when the seeds of a new ideology are sewn that sets it apart from traditional religions. 1995 will also be a year when an unknown, powerful male individual begins to come into prominence who spellbinds the world and gathers followers around him in much the same rat-catching manner as the Pied Piper of Hamelin. For this reason, in one prophecy, he is called the rat-catcher. These events coincide with many innovations and discoveries in technology and science; for 1995 and the ensuing years bring incredible breakthroughs that will change civilization. One contributing factor to these breakthroughs in the near future will be, finally, the exposure and rectification of an error in the Pi-number calculation.

Precipitated by the previously mentioned climate weapon, the entire Earth will be subjected to very problematic climatic changes when overall temperatures fall, that is, they drop dramatically. The result will be that land masses and oceans will freeze because of Man's insanity. Consequently, a new invention will be developed that, powered by the most economical of energies, artificially heats the Earth's atmosphere. This is the moment when Japan and China will discover that the prevailing physics is not the last word in knowledge, but that there exists yet a higher level of physics which extends into fine-matter spheres. Upon this realization, science will be discredited for some time. Nonetheless, space exploration will continue and a new world discovered in this process; a new Earth that will be suitable for maintaining human terrestrials. The actual period when space travel and with its many related discoveries commence will begin already in the very near future, however. Overall, expeditions into space will be successful, e.g., terrestrials will discover, or rather locate, ancient human traces and effects left behind on Mars. This will present sufficient reason for terrestrials to build, furbish and fly new spaceships with even greater ranges into the vastness of space, to make ever greater, more interesting and, especially, more significant discoveries. Initially, these spaceships will travel over relatively long periods of time until propulsion systems are developed that make super-speed space travel without timeshifts feasible. Spaceships reaching velocities above the speed of light, indeed, speeds several million times the speed of light, will one day become the rule. But until this occurs, several hundreds of years, even millennia, will pass. Still, these aforementioned predictions shall occur in the near and somewhat more distant future and mankind will not be kept waiting too much longer; even elderly people alive today will experience the commencement of these predictions. The discovery, refurbishing and renewed operation of ancient extraterrestrial artifacts and stations on Mars in the not-too-distant future, and much later in other places as well, will be accomplished by our more distant descendants. These events are also associated with grave danger, however, for dangerous diseases and epidemics will be brought back to Earth by way of space travel, along with the exceedingly vicious 'wolf' as one prediction calls this horror, which could be a horrifying animal or a deadly epidemic. The definition of the "wolf" is not clear yet and its explanation is still pending. According to the prediction, this deadly factor will be introduced or carried to Earth either by ordinary space travellers or lawbreaking space travellers. Additionally, in the distant days ahead, the discovery of a new and very significant substance is foretold; one that will benefit Man greatly - as long as he is able to utilize it to his own benefit. This entire scenario transpires at a time when a new order exists on Earth that satisfies, in an inexpensive manner, all needs of Man. New, overall-like suits for humans will be invented and produced that will enable Man to fly through the air freely without aid from any other devices. Barely three decades prior to this event, however, a third DNA information code will be discovered in the human body, and the first concrete steps will be undertaken to eliminate diseases in the elderly, heart diseases and attrition. After approximately 25 years, these efforts will prove successful. Simultaneously, once the appropriate steps are taken, the feasibility of a classless society, as well as technologically-biological prerequisites, will emerge that deal with the worldwide cleanup of the polluted rivers, lakes and oceans. This praiseworthy progress will be negated, however, by an extremely negative invention in form of a biological weapon; it will wreak tremendous havoc and induce instant aging in humans and animals (in seconds). Shortly thereafter the period of "nocturnal dawning" comes into existence, as stated in another prediction. This "nocturnal dawning" will be a new technological achievement whereby the dark side of planet Earth is illuminated by an artificial sun affixed to a space station; this device will not create full daylight, but a bright, dawnlike condition.

The artificial sun in the sky will virtually ring in a new age, the Age of Space Conquest on a grand scale. From here on, space travel definitively will become commercial and turn into a significant, powerful institution by which Man, through science, will pursue the enigma of Creation and with it the origin of life and all existence. Of course, these events will make science very respectable again especially as they relate to the institution of space travel, which will control the scientists. Ultimately, this will not turn out well and will transpire as it must: This space travel institution will increasingly ignore the terrestrial governments and science, deal with them unfairly, and will generate conflicts again that provide the most auspicious base for a new war. All of this will come into play barely 15 years after the aging gene is isolated and neutralized, when the human biologic aging process is largely surmounted, and the related previous vicious genetic manipulation finally remedied again. A looming new war will break out and last for approximately 40 years. During this period or about 6 years prior, humans will be converted into machines, that is, robots for the first time by connecting their nervous system to microscopic electronic-biologic gadgetry and machinery that will serve to guide them. This will cause great problems about 85 years later, when the now powerful scientists begin to play 'God', as they had done in earliest times, and they will create new hybrids between humans and animals through genetic alterations. These new 'semi-humans' will declare their solidarity with the robotic humans. But before this transpires, another 80 years will pass after the creation of robotic humans, as I mentioned previously. With the creation of robotic humans, intelligent, biologic-electronic-machinelike robots will be constructed. A gigantic space station will be built, upon which a vast number of humans will live while the station travels in its own orbit around the Sun.

Because of Man's intrinsic attitude, induced by his degeneration, wars and revolts will occur on Mars. These events will transpire when humans, after conferring with extraterrestrials, construct residential buildings beneath the oceans which will dangerously interfere with the ecologic equilibrium of the oceans, land masses and the air. Once again the time will arise when another new, dangerous, fatal weapon is invented that will disintegrate the bones of life forms. Simultaneously, the artificial sun created about fifty years prior will drift from its orbit and over a mere seventy-two hour period will plunge to Earth. The Earth's own rotation and orbit around the Sun will change then and result in the reduction in the length of years, days and nights. Unfortunately, this will also be the time when the first space conflict - a space war - takes place between terrestrials and those humans who will have migrated to Mars by then. The gigantic space station in orbit behind the Sun will be damaged. At this time a new terrestrial chronology will be contemplated because the altered lengths of the days and seasons on Earth cannot be utilized in the old system.

Terrestrial humanity already under the spell of religions and religious sects at this time, will remain spellbound for several more centuries. Following the installation of the new terrestrial chronology, the founder of a new religion will come to the forefront and revoke the Christian Sunday, Islamic Friday and Jewish Sabbath, in order to establish a new holiday schedule. As an experiment, money will be briefly abolished, but clandestine trading with valuable goods such as precious metals, diamonds and other commodities will continue. Sometime later the insane terrestrials wretchedly will alter the Earth's atmosphere in a dreadful format.

And another war on Earth will ensue, for terrestrials will have failed in their attempt to become more peaceloving and intelligent. The future will hold nothing positive pertaining to scientists because they will have begun to perform their first genetic manipulations on humans and animals by this time, and will be creating entities, so-called 'semi-humans', whom they will produce by crossing humans with pigs and then train them as fighting machines. These entities will be sent into war and also perform a variety of tasks in space. However, this situation will not go well very long. The entities will oppose their creators, like it is also the case with robotic humans who will have arms and legs amputated so that their nervous system can be attached to minute electronic-biologic devices, whereby these semi-humans become living navigational devices for spaceships and every type of weaponry, machinery and terrestrial vehicles, to name but a few. A man will appear and present the universal teachings to the entire terrestrial human population. He will be remarkably successful, although existing religions and religious sects will follow up with global countermeasures - as has been the case since ancient times. The teachings of the spirit will be included in this teachings, and some fourty years later the teachings of reincarnation will have been disseminated worldwide and accepted by the existing religions. However, prior to this event some unpleasant encounters with extraterrestrials will take place that may result in a gratifying union depending upon which direction Man takes; taking the wrong direction will result in disagreeable, possibly even dangerous prospects. Through technological intervention, Man will slowly learn to prevent natural catastrophes. Volcanos, in particular, will be placated and their activity controlled, as will be the influences of weather conditions. Triggered by the invention or, rather, discovery of a new and very valuable energy source and its rights to ownership, renewed war activities on Earth will ensue. Problems will also occur within human populations because their relative immortality, that is, the increase in human longevity, will amount to life spans of from 350 to 450 years. This increase in longevity will also precipitate increasingly greater problems of overpopulation and all other subsequent obstacles, which will include migrations that will result in new types of interbred peoples. Among them will be a group who call themselves Eurasians. They will demand the Eurasian region for their homeland at a time when the 'semi-humans', those human-animal, genetically-manipulated creatures and the robot-humans will be creating incredible problems. These difficulties will lead to the deplorable decline of every space travel program and nearly bring space travel to a complete standstill. The problem will come about because of the robot-humans' and semi-humans' refusal to continue working for normal human beings, and because of their unwillingness to continue a life of subservience and exploitation as living maneuvering devices for spaceships, vehicles, equipment, war machines and so other gadgetry. These events will transpire at a time when a climatic reversal begins on Earth because of the Sun's noticeably weakening activity triggered by reduced nuclear fusions within it.

Terrestrial Man's urge to explore knows no bounds and, consequently, he will penetrate ever deeper into space; unfortunately, this tendency will also produce repercussions. Inevitably, unexpected disasters will occur, for the prediction states that in the not too distant future, terrestrial Man will face some extremely terrifying phenomenon during his space expeditions that will present great and trying obstacles. One event, supposedly twenty years later, will take place as the frightening and definite conclusion is reached that the Sun is truly a dying star. And an additional thirty-five years later, terrestrial human beings will face a new horror when one of their exploration spaceships brings a deadly epidemic back to Earth that will leave medical scientists completely helpless. By this time, Man will have gained knowledge about the essence of Creation for thirty-five years; likewise, the truth will be understood that negatives and positives represent within themselves equal, independent units although they also form a perfect unit when joined. The previously mentioned space-exploration craft will lift off shortly after this cognizance, whereupon it will encounter the great horrors. Equipped with a completely new propulsion system, the expedition spacecraft is expected to penetrate space to the extent that it will reach the original home planets of the first genetically manipulated peoples. Such an undertaking will still be completely irresponsible on the part of the terrestrials from that period. On one hand, they will have remained trapped in their genetically manipulated degeneration and, on the other, in their megalomania they will vastly fail to underestimate the dangers of space and alien worlds. They will become aware of their failings only midway along their path toward the home planets of the genetically manipulated peoples' origins, when the expedition will be confronted by terrifying extraterrestrial life. Ultimately, this space expedition becomes feasible only when the technological apparatuses, machinery, all electronic instruments and many other items from that period are no longer operated and piloted by human beings. The technological devices will become equipped instead with independent, biological intelligence that makes all piloting and operations almost infallible. The robot-humans still performing those functions at that time will rebel against this change of events. Simultaneously, terrestrial space travel will reach the pinnacle of its development as research forges on, and soon further deductions and solutions will unlock additional secrets of matter. Concurrent with this development will begin the rule by the robot people under the leadership of someone from their own ranks, who will be the enemy of all other human life forms and cause a great stir, although he will die very soon after these events. During this same period, once again, the megalomanic scientists will perform an incredible spectacle by producing a gigantic second sun. Although this group of scientists will be small in number, nonetheless, through a dangerous experiment they will ignite one of the SOL planets, which will burn for seven days and glisten in the SOL system as a second sun before it burns out and fades. Jupiter and Saturn could be equally suitable candidates for this experiment as they are uncompleted miniature suns, making redundant the selection of planets for this future insanity. Great progress in brain research will occur in the same period, including the implantation of micro modules into human and animal scalps. The micro modules will assume and execute all the brain's navigational functions. At this time, far from Earth, an artificial world within another alien solar system will be populated by an immense migration surge that stems from the continued, irrational increases in terrestrial overpopulation. The robot people, simultaneously, will become a danger to normal human beings through their own propagation and the siring of many descendants. Due to genetic alterations, these descendants will be born without arms and legs, with their nerve endings already exposed. This will permit easy access to the nerve endings of their extremities, which can then be attached without surgery to various devices and machinery, etc. The robot people will become a true menace to normal humans, for they will possess unforeseen consciousness-related powers. Over time, they will further develop these powers by way of an above-normal application of their consciousness whereby the brain, through unique, painstakingly constructed energy generators, will be endowed with special energies from the outside. All of this will allow the forces of the consciousness to perform at record levels.

The time will come when further powerful changes take place within the SOL system as the Sun's nuclear fusions decrease. Indeed, the entire gravity field will not only become unmanageable and changed, but large-scale climatic changes will become the daily norm. These occurrences will inspire scientists to record performances because they will wish to find methods to counteract the Sun's negative consequences. These consequences will manifest themselves far sooner than anticipated in fact, and contradict millennia-old, erroneous scientific assumptions. Only then will people correctly realize that the Sun is a dying celestial body and that, subsequently, the end of the SOL system will herewith be predetermined already. Nonetheless, the Sun will continue to exist another billion years, but by then it will be a dead star that will, ultimately, be swallowed up and destroyed by a Black Hole. Therefore, scientists will begin performing at feverish rates. In the process they will discover that the base for pi was miscalculated. By eliminating the error in pi, and correcting future computations based on pi, scientists and their amazing, highly developed technology will have the capability to make unimaginable energies accessible to the people of Earth. This will be accomplished through the terrestrials' diversion and utilization of energies from Black Holes from within the Milky Way system. Scientists at this time, though, will still be unable to travel to the center of our galaxy to tap the existing Black Hole in that region. Still, it will be unnecessary to go to the center of our galaxy, at least at that particular time, for nearby objects will produce sufficient energy to serve Earth's needs. This new energy source, in fact, the energy type itself, will enable terrestrials to develop new forms of space travel. In the wake and expansion of these developments, a travel and transportation factor becomes reality which, prior to 1995 and long into the future, had been called fantasy: Time travel. This discovery/invention, in turn, will enable Man to travel into both the past and the future, and as well into the vastness of the Universe, something that was hitherto impossible. In the aftermath of these events new human life forms will be discovered, without doubt, and humans of Earth will learn unfathomable information from these extraterrestrials, for these ETs will possess remarkably greater intelligence than the terrestrials. Developments in every field will progress rapidly and result in the creation of artificial, biological intelligences that will be utilized for the guidance and handling of all apparatuses, devices, electronics, machinery including flying craft and vehicles. By this time there will be no concern of these biological intelligences becoming independent to later endanger terrestrials as it will be the case with the robot people, who will no longer be of any use and be exterminated without further ado.

The time will then come when all space stations and satellites orbiting the Earth, Mars and Venus will crash. This will be the result of the Sun's ever decreasing activity having changed to such an extent that monumental gravitational changes of all planets will occur, even to the Sun itself. Scientists will be working at record levels to find solutions for the changes, but they will be unsuccessful. Yet, they will have success in as much as they will discover an incredibly important factor in the Creational formula. Thereafter another danger from space will threaten the terrestrial world, this time from the depths of the central Universe. The danger from this threat will become evident only much later, however. Prior to this event, terrestrial humans will place artificial suns into orbit around the Earth, albeit far beyond the customary distance. Terrestrials will not have much luck with these satellites either, for one of the artificial suns will begin to glow due to severe damage and scorch large regions on Earth. In turn, the aftermath of these events will dangerously affect Earth's atmosphere and produce an oxygen deficiency that precipitates worldwide riots. From this catastrophe another will evolve because the scorched land and lack of oxygen cannot remain without consequences either. The catastrophe will affect the economy and the entire food processing industry and will result in a famine the likes of which the world has never seen nor experienced over the past thousands of years. This will signify the beginning of the end for conventional space travel, for barely one decade later time travel, through the advancement of technology, will become routine. Millions of light years will be bridged, that is, traversed, without any time loss, and human beings will no longer experience limitations in their conquest of distances. This also is the time when geriatric research, through genetic reverse-manipulation, will release the human population from the premature aging's curse; a curse that was brought about, long ago, in the initial fighting peoples' genes by the gene manipulators, the "creator-overlords". This reverse manipulation will afford Man an even longer life span than that achieved by terrestrial geneticists through prior procedures, whereby human lives increased to an average life expectancy of four hundred years. These new achievements will produce an extremely long human life expectancy of thousands of years. In the ensuing few years the time will come when intelligent ocean dwellers will begin to contact human beings and communicate with them, and a new race of terrestrial inhabitants will thereby be founded. Then the time will come when aggressions with Martian inhabitants will begin and result in the actual launching of attacks on the colonies. These events will be followed by fifteen years of relative calm, finally bringing good fortune to the Earth's human inhabitants in their quest to find their actual origins. A terrestrial space expedition will penetrate into the regions of Sirius and discover, or rather locate there, proof of the Ur-Ur-Ur-ancestry of the human beings on Earth, who previously were procreated through genetic manipulations in ancient times by the Sirius "creator-overlords". This discovery will reveal that over many millennia, the terrestrials' ancestors fled across long twisting paths, found the SOL system and began settling there. Thus, humankind on Earth will eventually find its direction back to its origin - which, of course, will not suddenly resolve mankind's problems by any means. Of course, linked to this discovery will also be contacts with very distant ancestors of the previous "creator-overlords", as well as other intelligences from Sirius that will, by then, no longer lead to the pursuit and slaughter of the genetically-manipulated descendants, the terrestrials. The contacts will lead to a collaboration instead, resulting in the previous genetic manipulation's definitive reversal. This action, in turn, will result in the birth of new descendants who will be normal and no longer be degenerate. The circle finally closes and Man will become a true human being, in equilibrium with the negative and positive.

The reversal of this previous degeneration-gene manipulation, along with the continually climbing overpopulation, precipitated even more so by the extraordinary human longevity, will result in plans for the eradication of those humans in whom the genetic reverse manipulation had not yet been performed, on Earth as well as on all other worlds colonialized by terrestrials, and space stations inhabited by them. This eradication will transpire in the same manner previously proclaimed and demanded by responsible individuals a very long ago: A worldwide halt in the birthrate over a seven-year cycle. Within this framework, only parents whose degeneration was previously eradicated through genetic reverse-manipulation will be permitted to procreate. Only those individuals, therefore, will be legally entitled to sire any offspring. Illegal pregnancies will be assessed as the most abhorrent crime, punishable by death to the guilty parties. This concept will only come about as an inescapable law five years before the period when complete authority over planet Earth is placed into the hands of the administrative sphere within the Sirius alliance, and enforced therefrom. Nonetheless, in these distant days ahead, Earth scientists will be ambitious; they will fulfill new objectives, make new discoveries, and capture chemistry's last remaining secrets. Despite the incredible knowledge that extraterrestrial intelligences will have passed on to the terrestrials, by far not every mystery about everything will have been penetrated or unraveled. Therefore, research will continue into all facet including that of astronomy, and scientists will subsequently penetrate to the center of the Milky Way to investigate its secrets and those of the Black Hole.

The Sun's activity will increasingly cause more concern, as it becomes notably weaker and unable to provide sufficient energy to supply Earth and Mars with light and warmth. In these distant, future times artificial suns will routinely orbit the Earth at a considerable distance so as to brighten and heat its surface. This situation will not remain benign either as one can deduce from an event that will occur seventy years after capital punishment for illicit procreation becomes law, when two of these artificial suns will destructively collide with one another, inflicting severe damage.

These, then, are the overall predictions for a succession of future centuries, whereby the sequence of these enumerations has become somewhat intermixed, and only the most significant future events are mentioned here. In addition to these events, many other things will transpire concurrently, e.g., of a political, military, religious, scientific, evolutionary and cosmic nature; the prediction that the terrestrial social formats of states still prevalent in 1995 will be abolished and replaced with new programs, whereby the individual no longer must personally make provisions for his or her old age through his personal finances, because society, or rather the federal state, will pay for it. A very inexpensive energy source will increase food supply production to the point where food can be distributed without charge. More of this incredibly inexpensive energy will be generated than Man on Earth can utilize. The cost of living will therefore drop to nearly zero. Pension plans, for example, along with other financial support systems, will become redundant, if for no other reason than the fact that virtually no income will be required any longer for a person's livelihood. At this point money will completely lose its value for these very same purposes, except for the fulfillment of personal pleasures, i.e., for recreational and pastime activities, etc. Nevertheless, such actions will not produce solutions to every monetary problem to the point where money will be totally eliminated as legal tender once and for all. People from Earth will continue to be caught up with their thoughts of using money in the near and more distant future; and many hundreds of years will be marked by its use, although two attempts to completely eliminate money will be initiated. These endeavors are doomed, however, because Man simply does not wish to detach himself in the near future from money and wealth. For this reason, all related efforts will be undermined because gold, silver, platinum, palladium, and other valuable, still undiscovered metals, precious stones, jewelry and other items sold illicitly, which will ultimately lead to the collapse of the attempts to abolish money. Money may eventually be prohibited by law in the distant future; such a development is just as predestined to occur as the one in the near future when the breeding of animals will be abolished. Geneticists will eventually discover a method that enables plants to produce the animal protein required by human beings. Scientists will finally realize that this process is actually feasible through genetic manipulation. This realization is to be expected very soon, although its enactment will not occur until much later. Blame for this delay can be placed on the anti-genetic-manipulation gripers who, insanely and incomprehensibly, are against gene technology and gene manipulation. Anti-gripers' efforts must be blamed, therefore, for the burden upon life for long-time mass-breeding, mass-transports and mass-tortures of billions of animals. The solutions brought about by vegetable-animal protein production and a perfectly acceptable meat substitute could have been effected long before through gene-technology to be marketed as food supplies, were it not for the decades of insane anti-griping efforts that impede these actions. The blame for the suffering of many billions of animals must be directed toward these idiotic gripers until they are ultimately forced into silence and kept quiet. Only then will the ills of mass animal breeding and all other related tortures for animals find an end.

The predictions also failed to mention that scientists will soon realize that Earth's atmosphere is truly not conducive to prolonging human longevity. Although mention is made in the predictions of the genetically-manipulated descendants' adaption to the Earth's atmosphere, no information is given about scientists discovering the Earth's atmosphere being unsuitable for human beings, and the fact that it contributes greatly to their rapid aging process. Furthermore, no mention is made about scientific discoveries which will, supposedly, lead to the imminent production of air that is more healthful and beneficial to the human body than before. This air will be a different yet more suitable composition and will be available for purchase both in bottles for personal consumption and as "little life extenders". Currently the oxygen-nitrogen proportion of terrestrial air is not only unsuitable, but its oxygen content is much too low and it also contains a variety of dangerous gases inhaled by humans.

Regarding the Earth itself, a fact not mentioned in the predictions is that, all along, the scientists were unaware that this planet was not expanding over the millennia through the accumulation of falling star dust and meteors, etc., but that, imperceptibly, it has been expanding internally. This means that an imperceptible expansion process is ongoing for millennia whereby, slowly but surely, the Earth's internal riches are transported to the surface. Over time, this expansion process will accelerate in correlation with the Sun's decreasing nuclear fusion rate through which all gravity fields within this entire solar system will change, in particular those of all the planets.

In the predictions made so far, mention was made about the terrestrials' discovery of time travel, and how to break into future and past dimensions. However, no mention was made about the discovery and locations of other dimensions, and the revelation of untold opportunities for Man. Yet, once again, many dangers will be linked to their discoveries; some will be of a physical nature, while others will be the result of encounters with intelligences from other dimensions. To this end, renewed conflicts will erupt and many events will become a reality that previously were slighted as science-fiction fantasies. Many more power struggles and revolts will take place on Earth even at times when governments no longer reside on this planet, but will orbit in space stations surrounding it. These governments will not find a safe haven there for long as some predictions mention that the rulers will be overthrown up there. Through faults and machinations of scientists, an evil time will follow once again, whereupon Man will utilize the services of an animal that harbors much negativity, viciousness and degeneration. This condition will be revealed to Man and be provoked by the scientists' service agreement. Consequently, the animal (or animals) will begin to attack people to a point where it/they will actually hunt terrestrials, and masses of humans will be slaughtered. The prediction, unfortunately, does not divulge any information on whether the animal(s) will be introduced to Earth from the vastness of the Universe, or whether it will originate on the Earth itself. In any case, human beings throughout the world will be forced to defend themselves against these animals. But the human population's efforts will be futile, and for this reason everyone on Earth will have little choice than to flee to the one continent which will be forged into a gigantic fortress. Three hundred years later, scientists will once again create a horrendous calamity, for their conceit and arrogance will push them to the point where they see themselves as "God", and in their megalomania they will perceive themselves as equals to Creation and as being irreplaceable in every way. Afterward, nearly one hundred years later, a very vicious and aggressive act takes place on Man's neighbor planet, Mars, when numerous spaceships will attack and completely annihilate the planet until even its substance is eliminated. During this period, the Destroyer planet will one again create havoc. This ancient roaming celestial body will enter the inner solar system on a collision course with Earth as a result of the Sun's rapidly dwindling nuclear activity and the subsequent total alteration of the gravity fields within the entire solar system. The Destroyer previously caused repeated destruction in the old Lyra regions over millions of years. Only sparsely populated by that time, the Earth will be faced with the threat of complete annihilation resulting from this destructive wanderer, and terrestrials will be incapable of safeguarding themselves against it. Because of the suddenly depleted gravity fields, now completely out of control throughout the entire solar system, the terrestrials are unable to direct the Destroyer into another orbit or annihilating the Destroyer. Neither alternative will benefit the Earth, for by this time it will be uninhabitable because of the monumental solaric changes. As a consequence, the remaining few million terrestrials will flee, departing from the planet in hopes of finding an alternative planet elsewhere and of settling there. They get help from the descendants of former terrestrials from the Sirius regions.

Everything will transpire as it must: After the disastrous blunders by terrestrial scientists, terrestrials will suffer from the scientists' attempts to destroy the Destroyer, and the scientists' arrogance and conceit will plummet. They will congregate around them ordinary people and flee from the threatened planet Earth. Only three years later the Destroyer will enter the former orbit of Mars and ram into the two Martian moons, Phobos and Deimos, which had remained intact during the planet's destruction. The two moons will disintegrate and trail behind the huge roaming planet as it continues to race toward Earth and ultimately reaches it, but does not ram into it. Nonetheless, the near-collision will result in a catastrophic event in which the Destroyer smashes into the Earth's moon. This will cause both the Moon and the Destroyer to shatter into a myriad of pieces, which will form a rotating belt orbiting around the Earth. The oceans, lakes and rivers will also be torn from their beds at this time, and will evaporate into the atmosphere from the ensuing immense heat. The steam, along with gigantic portions of the atmosphere, will be wrenched into space and then dissipate while, at the same time, the Earth's imperceptible expansion process over the past thousands of years becomes evident now. The Earth will heat up from its interior and the planet's surface will ultimately become uninhabitable.

Meanwhile, Mercury will enter a collision course with the Sun and will plunge thereon to produce a catastrophe that signifies the destruction of the final remaining harmony within the SOL system. For nearly 100 years afterward, the Sun will generate gigantic eruptions and nuclear fusions once again, as well as protuberances that will extend far into space. By this time the planetary orbits will be destroyed to a point where they will no longer circle around the Sun. No longer will it radiate nor will it become a Super-Nova. After all of this transpires, the Sun will glow and glimmer weakly and generate occasional gaseous explosions along with nuclear fusion activity. Even these conditions will increasingly diminish as time goes on, and eventually all activity will cease completely, whereupon the Sun will drift through space as a dead, dark star, surrounded by equally dead planets. The end will come when the dead Sun, along with the accompanying satellites that drift around it, are attracted and sucked into a Black Hole. Together they will condense with incredible force and stagnate there until they, and other material within the Black Hole, are ejected in one massive explosion. This event will generate fresh gases, fine particles and other elements that will develop into new galaxies, stars, planets, moons and other forms. These developments will cover many billions of years; according to calculations roughly 10 billion years will pass before the Sun and its planets die, exist while dead, and then are swallowed and annihilated by the aforementioned Black Hole.

The predictions also provide important insight into women's future role alongside men. In the more distant future, women will fully regain their former original equal status and rights in the men's world with regard to their complete duties, assignments and tasks. A joint female-male relationship will come to exist, as it did in earliest times when men and women stood shoulder-to-shoulder, with total equality of rights as they functioned and worked together. As it was in early times, so will it be again in the distant future, i.e., women with children shall first and foremost dedicate themselves to their offspring by grooming and educating them, among other things, and will maintain the household. Just as they have done from ancient times, men will attend to and exert themselves for those matters and concerns which were designated to them throughout antiquity due to their male physique, etc. Therefore, the modern proliferation by the women's liberation movements and the single-handed push by women into upper management and responsible positions for their sole supremacy, to mention a few things, will be eliminated once and for all, in order to make room for equality and equal rights that will hold true for both men and women. As a result, men and women will work together jointly on all tasks and will deal with them equally. Neither one man nor one women will elevate him- or herself above the other in rank or power regarding business, administration, government, power and other situations, as is the case today.

It is very important to realize, too, that many negative events will occur in the near future regarding diseases and epidemics on Earth. For this reason all humans must become very meticulous about their personal hygiene and must avoid physical contact with people of questionable health status. There should be paid great attention for harmless disesases and infections, because in future times these can turn into much graver and even incurable illness. The same will hold true also for physical contact with animals, including touching of any type. An additional concern will be the intake of animal-origin food products, absorption of viruses, bacteria, etc., of animal substances such as feces, saliva, blood, hair and so forth, which can cause also fatal diseases and epidemics. For this reason alone, creatures of every type should not be kept within the confines of human residences, indeed, they must not be tolerated therein even briefly.

The following facts explain the ancestry of the Pleiadians, or rather the Plejarans, and the old Lyrians: The Pleiadians, as distant descendants of the ancient Lyrians, maintain contact neither with the Sirius intelligences nor today's descendants of the former "creator-overlords", regardless of whether they possess positive or negative characteristics. They have no plans for such contacts, not now nor in the near future. Nonetheless, their divergent paths will come full-circle and one day they will join again, taking place, at the earliest, when the genetic manipulations are reversed. Only then will the descendants of the former "creator-overlords" be sufficiently advanced in their evolution to allow for any contact between the Pleiadians and themselves. The same also holds true for Sirius intelligences who are completely different human races outside the Enoch (Henok) lineage; indeed, they have no hereditary link whatsoever with the descendants of the former "creator-overlords". Today's Pleiadians, or rather Plejarans, and the Lyrians, along with the current peoples of the Enoch-Nokodemion lineage (or Nokodemion-Enoch) who reside in the DAL Universe, are all part and parcel of the human life form that is exceedingly elevated in its consciousness and spirituality. They are no longer capable of contacting lesser evolved human life forms, such as Earth humans, inhabitants of the Sirius regions and many other human races on other worlds, without endangerment through the lower vibrations from these life forms, who are less-evolved beings. Furthermore, Pleiadian/Plejaran laws prohibit them from contacting these less-evolved entities, and interfering in their internal affairs. Such actions would dangerously intrude upon the self-determined evolution of these less-evolved beings. As it is the case with any other life form, each human life form must evolve through its own strength. Higher-evolved life forms are permitted to extend to the less-evolved beings certain realizations and prospects only through impulses which, on one hand, cannot be recognized as such and, on the other, do not lead to opportunities that would accord greater and more extensive realizations and prospects than those sustained by lower evolutionary levels. Based upon this justification, the Pleiadians have elected to contact neither the descendants of the past "creator-overlords" within the Sirius regions and other locations nor the actual Sirius intelligences themselves.

When the Old Lyrians ventured to Earth ages ago and commenced their activities among the terrestrials whose actual origins were elsewhere as explained earlier several times, they selected periods when neither the positive nor negative "creator-overlords", or their distant descendants, were present in the SOL system or on Earth, respectively, after the "creator-overlords" had again vacated this region. The Old Lyrians, and later the Pleiadians/Plejarans, were always vigilant, for they had no desire to encounter the "creator-overlords" or their descendants. They did not want a confrontation since they wished to travel their own path but, additionally, they did not want to be driven into combat with the other Enoch (Henok) lineage due to their different world view. This discrepancy in world view eventually had led the "creator-overlords" to breed the genetically-manipulated peoples, an act of which both the Old Lyrians and their descendants, the Pleiadians/Plejarans, strongly disapproved. From this time onward they refrained from having any contact with Enoch-lineage inhabitants from the Sirius regions, as well as with those actual Ur-Sirius intelligences who were no better than the inhabitants from other locations. The Old Lyrians in the meantime had progressed in their evolution beyond that of the inhabitants from the Sirius regions, the other Enoch lineage, and the actual Sirius intelligences. And for this reason were any contacts with these groups out of the question since they would have been far too dangerous for their bodies, indeed, their lives. Although the Old Lyrians remained relatively aggressive, scheming and so forth, they were not deprived of simultaneous conscious and spiritual evolution, except for those people who forcibly refused to adapt to the evolutionary process. These groups were forced to leave the Lyra-Vega regions and others, whereupon they ventured into the SOL system. Among them were some benevolent and evolved individuals who took upon themselves the sacrifice of leaving along with the refugees, so they could continue their teaching mission of directing the refugees onto the path of humaneness and evolution. In the course of time they succeeded in reaching their goals, although many things repeatedly went awry. On Earth, these Old Lyrians intermingled with the terrestrials just as the "creator-overlords"' descendants from the Sirius regions had done previously. Thus the descendants of the Old Lyrians-Vegans were also confronted with and subjected to genetic manipulation in the same manner as all other humans on Earth. Their interactions took place in a relatively brief period, since approximately a paltry 3 thousand years later no human life forms could be found on the planet who were not heretically affected by the genetic manipulation. This applied to the 144,210 leaders, sub-leaders, and the very positive spiritual leaders who had voluntarily embraced the idea of instructing the refugees, along with several millions of ordinary people, in the spiritual teachings and in other matters. For this reason it is likely that since that time no single terrestrial human life form has existed who does not harbor the legacy of negative and positive degeneration, although it would manifest itself according to the individual's balance, whereas degenerations occur frequently in forms of both negativity and positiveness.

Although the Old Lyrians had greatly evolved by this time they nonetheless lacked obedience to the Creational-natural laws; they often transgressed against them, therefore, and wreaked much havoc. However, this was applicable only to those few million people who had fled in earlier times from their homeworlds. On Earth they behaved in much the same manner, and they consequently adopted religions established by the descendants of the "creator-overlords". They elevated themselves to creator-gods so as to spellbind the terrestrials. The Old Lyrians therefore were neither the true initiators nor the founders of the Ur-religions with their god-creators and creator-gods; instead they were merely the unscrupulous exploiters of the equally unscrupulous "creator-overlords"' descendants who initiated religious legends, religious fables, god fables, origin-of-the-world fables and other falsehoods. In doing so, on one hand, they wanted to conceal and allow the true origin of the SOL system's human beings from Mars, Malona and Earth to sink into obscurity - so they would not find their way back to the Sirius regions one day -; on the other hand, they anticipated that their initiated religions would create conflicts and wars among the genetically-manipulated peoples who would subsequently exterminate themselves. They hoped, therefore, that the human SOL system inhabitants would never rise again nor would they embark upon a return trip to their Ur-homeland.

The Old Lyrians-Vegans gradually began changing their mental outlook and started to abide by the spiritual teachings, hence, the Creational-natural laws and directives, whereupon their overall evolution began to advance rapidly, and they greatly elevated themselves spiritually. Consequently, they had to guard themselves even more and did not allow any type of contact whatever to occur between them and the descendants of the "creator-overlords" or with the intelligences from Sirius. After making peace with the inhabitants of their home planets, one Old Lyrian-Vegan group returned there, while a second faction withdrew to another dimension beyond the Pleiades constellation. Therefore, this group withdrew from our dimension just as the Old Lyrians-Vegans did previously, and these people found a new homeland beyond the Hyades star cluster, about 150 light years from Earth. A third faction left our universe, the DERN Universe, and penetrated into its twin universe, which is called DAL Universe, where they propagated and formed a gigantic federation together with many other peoples. The same situation occurred also with the Pleiadians/Plejarans, whose federation exists in a region approximately 7 billion light years in diameter and in a space-time configuration that deviates by a fraction of a second from our own. However, some of the federation members, or rather federation planets, exist in our space and time configuration.

This information should suffice for now and no special explanations are needed. Further discussion about the actual years would be a moot point in any event, for I consider any mention of the exact timing of these events completely out of place. An interesting item for the group, and for everyone else, may be that certain points pertaining to the extraterrestrial intelligences' visits had been off-limit for discussion for several years, except for those items your people, you in particular, had already mentioned. You had already told me that I could openly speak about them upon your withdrawal.

Ptaah

That is correct. We spoke only of those ancestors who played an important role up to the present, that is, the three groups we previously discussed in one of our last conversations. In addition to these groups there exist still a few other groups of extraterrestrial origin who visit Earth and are observed here relatively frequently. However, none of these groups maintains any form of contact with terrestrials, neither of a private nor military or governmental nature. Some visit Earth strictly for excursion or expedition purposes, while others maintain different interests; but not one of these groups has any type of contact whatever as it is presented by hysterical Americans, whereby terrestrial women are impregnated by extraterrestrial intelligences, or where men from Earth impregnate extraterrestrial women. Furthermore, you may forget the nonsense about the massacre of animals, etc. etc. Such matters have no factual basis. Extraterrestrials will create a big flurry on Earth in the future when their interests concern other matters than excursions or expeditions. However, we are not at liberty to speak about the whys and wherefores, and neither are you, of course, for you know about all of these future events.

Billy

Naturally. - But I still have a question: Is it not possible that some things you just mentioned may be responsible for claims made by Ed Walters in America, who also offers photos?

Ptaah

He is a swindler and a fraud, and his photos are counterfeit. This is an established fact.

Billy

Good, thanks. But why were we not allowed to mention those extraterrestrials of whom you just spoke?

Ptaah

On one hand this is related to the upcoming events and the new era on Earth. We are not permitted to speak about such things, as I have previously explained. On the other hand, unfortunately, careless leaks of this information would only lead to further hysteria, lies and fraud, along with deceit and charlatanry, as was the case already in America, Germany, England, Japan, Sweden and other places.

Billy

Yes, I know. In this regard, America especially leads the way in hysteria and idiocy.

Ptaah

That is correct, but MUFON alone must not be blamed for this entire hysteria; many religious sects and, in particular, the government itself must share in the blame. In fact, the latter hides a great deal of important proof about the existence of extraterrestrial life, and the appearances on Earth by these beings, in their secret and undercover files; indeed, the government prohibits by law contacts of terrestrials with extraterrestrial life forms. Another very lamentable factor is the fact that the American military constructs and tests flying objects with extreme secrecy, although many outsiders are knowledgeable about these events and even hold proof of these activities, simply because they were able to observe, film and photograph them at any time, day or night.

Billy

And these flying objects have shapes that are unlike that of an airplane, and they possess propulsion systems and technological flight characteristics that traditional aircraft do not possess. But why are you speaking about these things now? We were not allowed to mention them before.

Ptaah

With our withdrawal the cloak of secrecy has been removed from us as well. Therefore, I am now permitted to speak about the various so-called UFO sightings that were observed in many countries throughout the world over the past four decades. Frequently they may be traced back to these terrestrial flying objects. They do not belong only to the Americans but to other countries on Earth as well. The real reason why we are allowed to speak now, after our current withdrawal, is the fact that for some time now all of these things were open secrets in certain circles. Therefore, we are not divulging anything that is considered a secret in the near future, as is the case with actual government and military secrets, in which case we have neither permission to intervene nor can we currently reveal them. At this time we are confirming certain things and events that previously could not be considered actual secrets for quite some time.

Billy

In a number of countries on Earth, flying objects are being developed that successfully resemble alien and extraterrestrial vehicles due to their strange, untraditional construction. The styles of these flying devices range from the beamship shapes your people made known all the way to the triangular forms, among many others. It is no wonder, therefore, that observers regard these flying objects as UFOs, or rather, as spaceships or simply as extraterrestrial flying craft; last, but not least, also because these craft are silent or nearly silent and possess flying characteristics that are alien and contrary to flight techniques known on Earth. Now you have a repetition of your explanations. A double stitching holds up better.

Ptaah

That is correct.

Billy

In my 23 pages I forgot to mention also that the terrestrial beings were actually one single race during Enoch's (Henok) ancient times. From this one race other races formed due to climatic and atmospheric changes, and splits that created new breeds once again. These mixed among themselves, and new races were created once again. Over the course of time, not only did the skin color of humans change but also their outward appearance, yet always in tune with the new surroundings, new living conditions and other influences. This, of course, resulted in genetic changes in addition to those changes produced by the genetic manipulations. However, the changes were not significant enough for the original and basic link not to remain evident that all humans on Earth originated from the same, single Ur-stock. Hence, when the humans from the Lyra regions and other locations interbred with the early emigrants, respectively their descendants nearly 190,000 years ago on Earth, the cycle was complete among people of the same stock. And then, when the peoples separated again in large spurts, and the most diverse regions of the Earth were newly inhabited, further changes in skin color, outward appearance and genes transpired again, This time, too, the Ur-breed remained intact, and it can be genetically proven that the terrestrials originated from a single Ur-race.


Ptaah

Indeed, you actually did fail to mention this in your report.

Billy

Something else in this regard: I have been thinking that while redoing and correcting the PROPHECIES, we could also incorporate the 23 pages. There are actually only one or two prophecies, the remainder consists of predictions. How do you feel about this?

Ptaah

It would probably be appropriate for you to integrate everything together into your new book.

Billy

Certain people probably are going to get into a flap over it for sure; but that does not really matter. We are used to such things. Still, anyone who wishes to be heard must create a disturbance, and whoever wishes to create a disturbance must repeat the same things several times. Only by creating a disturbance, human beings will become aware of some person or some facts presented to them, because they will either feel personally attacked or because it bothers them to hear the same facts two or three times. It is the only way to stimulate people into thinking, regardless of whether it is in a peaceful or angry way. The only important thing is the result, that is to say, the fact that one way or another they feel attacked and, therefore, only then do they begin to ponder things and react. - But now something else: Recently I stumbled across the fact that we spoke against hatred toward strangers and other races in our small campaign texts, but we have never really delved into the subject or produced any separate booklets on it. In the future we will do so and, together with Bernadette, I have designed stickers for this subject matter. Here they are. What do you think of them? These are already at the printers, these 3 I would like to have made up next week.

Ptaah

They are very nice and express a great deal about the individual subject matter. I like them very much. I would be delighted if you would let me have about three of each one - and of those you now have as well. I would like to begin a collection of them. Quetzal still has some Swiss money remaining from the time you purchased various items for us. I would like to give you this money as a contribution toward the printing costs of these stickers. It must be nearly CHF 500.00.

Billy

Of course -- you can have as many stickers as you wish. And the money we certainly like to have, too. I thank you on behalf of the entire group.

Ptaah

Please convey my thanks and greetings to the group members also, and to all of the groups in California, Sweden, Toronto, Japan and, of course, to all friends of the Mission and all Passive Group members as well. I also pass on these thanks and greetings of behalf of my daughters Semjase and Pleija, and also Asket, Neera, Menara, Isodos, Talida, Quetzal and all the others who know you from photos and our TV broadcasts, or from those people who encountered Core Group and Passive Group members during our visits to the Center, although these individuals rarely or never even noticed that we were nearby. I have also been asked to convey thanks and greetings from many people who know you only from hear-say.

Billy

Thank you.

Ptaah

It is . . . .

Billy

Please, the . . . .

Ptaah

This is correct. I also wanted to talk about that. But if you feel that matters really are as you just mentioned, it may be better to keep silent on it.

Billy

They are probably just as you said. Let's talk about something else: For some time now, the magazines and newspapers have been filled with war crime recollections by the Nazis in Germany. Radio and Television also have nothing better to do than to fan the memories of these crimes with every means possible. The Jewish organizations and associations, etc., do so especially. It is my opinion that these actions are just as abominable and criminal as the constant anti-war propaganda in form of so-called anti-war films, etc., as well as the magnified crimes of racism and torture. It is my personal opinion which is based on my knowledge of the human-psychologic reactions, that all of those people who shout "anti" and "contra" against torture and capital punishment, concentration camps, crime, wars in any form by showing those gruesome and horrifying pictures shown in newspapers, magazines, as well as on TV and in the cinemas of people getting massacred, tortured and murdered, of cemeteries being violated, houses burned among other things, are doing others a great disservice. They have no clue about the human psyche and psychology. If they knew anything about this, they would realize that their actions achieve exactly the opposite to what they intend because numerous misled, erroneous-thinking individuals feel attracted to such purported anti-propaganda. These people see that idiotic anti-propaganda and are then triggered toward the opposite effect, whereupon they want to act in the manner they are shown. For this reason, the neo-Nazi and right-extremist movements gain ever more ground. Unfortunately, this is a psychologic process which is really logical albeit unrecognized by those in charge and by the co-screamers of this insane anti-propaganda. Indeed, these people lack the knowledge of human nature and the knowledge of psychology. Anti-war films, anti-concentration camp films, anti-drug films, anti-torture and anti-capital punishment films that depict crimes in pictures and give descriptions, and movies that present such crimes in pictures by stimulating the readers' fantasy of these written words, achieve exactly the opposite of what they should do. Memories triggered by such moronic things provoke, in many people, the desire to act in the same way as the culprits who originally performed these atrocities - who also became insane through propaganda. Anyone wanting to speak up against these past and still prevailing horrors, must never do so in this moronic manner. Condemnation must occur by pointing out the current existing ills and their ominous consequences for the future. Memories of past events in accordance with the idiotic motto: "We must never forget Auschwitz" or "We must never let the horrors of the past be forgotten", etc., are completely out of place and dangerous, for they only prompt anew the identical evils and horrors of the past. Therefore this insanity must stop if the flames of neo-nazism and the extreme right radicalism are not to be fanned any further. Only by banning the anti-insanity in the above-mentioned form can healing begin. And a fight against all of these evils and harm can only be crowned with success if the means to fight are restricted to those methods that do not glorify the memories as it has been the case until now. Instead, the methods must delineate them in a form that points out the damage and the harm, and reveal the subsequent consequences they will result in. This is my personal opinion, and I'd like to hear yours too at this time.

Ptaah

I wholeheartedly agree with you. I need not add any further explanations except, possibly, that only truly responsible, clear-thinking and rational people will recognize this fact. One does not even require any psychological education; pure reason alone suffices to identify your factual explanation.

Billy

Of course, if this isn't the truth! - But tell me: In the middle of February, a severe earthquake occurred in Japan that caused more than 5000 deaths and immense damage. It was far, far more severe than the last major tremor in California, during which a great deal of plundering took place, and people behaved as though they had never been taught any decency and respect. This also happened in other places, in Mexico for instance, several South-American countries and elsewhere, where all law and order collapsed. All of this stands in direct contrast with Japan where such things hardly ever happened, and the people bore all hardships with admirable composure. Chaos and all other ills did not materialize the way they did in other countries, especially in America, where appropriate demeanor would have also been warranted. This appropriate demeanor was lacking as was a certain kind of culture. Indeed, Japanese organized crime groups even aided the population through food distribution and other things. This alone shows what true culture and honor, what composure and respect the Japanese possess. Chivalry and friendship are not simply empty phrases with them the way it is with many Americans who call you their friend very quickly. And yet the word has no substance for them - as we have so often seen over the past 20 years. Still, there are obviously also those Americans who are true friends and true human beings. To them friendship is a truly precious commodity. I, too, have such friends in America but unfortunately they are few in number. However, they are true, honest and good friends.

Ptaah

I am aware of this. The earthquake spread great suffering, misery, sadness and vast destruction throughout Japan and among the Japanese. Please convey to these people our deepest regrets and our great respect for their admirable conduct during those difficult times.

Billy

I'd be glad to, for I also feel a sense of high esteem and respect for them. Can any action whatever be taken against earthquakes?

Ptaah

The rule has shown, even on every one of our worlds within the federation, that hardly anything reasonable can be done to prevent severe quake damage once tall buildings, etc., have been constructed. For this reason we normally only have low, greatly reinforced buildings capable of withstanding the most severe earthquakes. Our worlds, too, live and are shaken by earthquakes, but our construction methods for buildings and their safety against planetary jolts are designed accordingly.

Billy

You also have houses and buildings that are not constructed from small pieces, that is, made from stone or cement blocks and so forth, since your buildings are made as single units from synthetic materials. There is not one seam anywhere, judging from what I have seen. Furthermore, they are constructed on systems of springs or as floating bodies.

Ptaah

This is correct, but these are merely two of the methods utilized to offset any jolting.

Billy

I did not claim that I knew everything. I only mentioned what I had observed during my visit. Besides, the earthquake was not the only alarming event on Earth in January. Throughout Europe, including Switzerland, monstrous storms and floods caused incredible damage.

Ptaah

This will also be the case from now on, for these disasters will increase worldwide even further, and so will storms, tornados, typhoons, hurricanes, floods, droughts and huge wild fires everywhere that will cause immense damage and many deaths on Earth. Earthquakes are also among these calamities that will cause yet even further damage and suffering, as will be the case also with wars and religious sectarianism, which is expected to initiate many sectarian dramas. Major crime and minor criminal activities will abound throughout the world, as will political and military turmoil. Islamic fundamentalism will become more extreme, and diseases and epidemics will increase among the terrestrial population. Of course, these crises will not take place at constantly high levels, for these things tend sometimes to increase or to decrease; therefore, at various periods the calamities will be more numerous and sometimes less so. They will continuously increase, however. The blame for this upward trend must be placed on the terrestrials, for through the constant increases in overpopulation they compound the increase in their every ill. Yet, we must really not spend any more time speaking about these matters because throughout the many years of our contacts everything of relevance has been discussed previously - and in vain, unfortunately. Human beings as a whole, especially those with responsible positions in governments and the military have chosen to ignore the population figures, although you and your entire group has made every effort and expended much energy and cost to publicize this information.

Billy

We do have some successes to show for it, because many people have picked up on our words and passed them on, along with their efforts to begin living and behaving according to our statements and suggestions.

Ptaah

This is correct, of course, but I spoke about the majority of terrestrials and the majority of the responsible people. Naturally, the minority is important, for it is these people who lead in this fight with great fervor. Unfortunately, they will reap very little gratitude, even though they are ultimately responsible for laying the cornerstone for the positive changes. In this regard you and your group are in the preeminent position.

Billy

Thanks for the "flowers" (The word "flowers" in this colloquial German phrase really means "compliments").

Ptaah

Now that we have withdrawn from Earth, I want to reiterate the issue, once again, that neither we Plejarans nor any of the allies within our federation are maintaining any contacts whatsoever with terrestrial human beings; neither in a physical nor a telepathic form. Indeed, such contacts have never existed except, however, for five particular individuals whose identity you already know, and who died several years ago. Not one of them ever publicized the knowledge he or she possessed. Yet, what we want to say though is that we do maintain impulse contacts with terrestrial scientists and others. We shall continue these contacts through appropriate devices, although the individuals involved have not nor will they ever know about the contacts in the future. These impulse contacts are determined by evolution and are guiding mankind toward the future, whereupon research and inventions will transpire, new knowledge will be gleaned, literary works in a futuristic form will be written, science fiction that will frequently be turned into motion pictures. You are the only person on Earth with whom we had and still maintain contact with in both physical and telepathic form - except for those individuals whom you knew and who have since died.

Billy

What about other extraterrestrial intelligences since? Do any of those maintain contacts with terrestrials at this time? I mean with private people and the like, who have no connections with governments and the military, about which you are not permitted to speak.

Ptaah

This question must be answered with a definite 'no', for none of the three groups who are constantly or frequently on Earth, maintains any private or religious contacts with individuals on Earth, which can also be affirmed with absolute certainty. This also applies to the many extraterrestrial visitors who come to Earth for excursions, expeditions or whatever other reasons. The "examination" contacts are excluded, because we are not speaking about them since they are not contingent upon two-way contacts.

Billy

This means that no contacts now exist between private citizens and extraterrestrials. And, just as you have stated, neither are there any contacts of a religions nature between terrestrials and extraterrestrials. This means, then, that the stigmatized man and his benefactor, Siragusa, are nothing more than frauds, liars and cheats. The stigmatist, Giorgio Bongiovanni, even wanted to come and bring me a very important message from the Holy Mother of God and the Father in Heaven himself. For nearly a week he had third parties pester us in a number of languages to arrange a meeting with me. He and his followers actually believe that his stigmata is a sign from God, while his signs, and those of all stigmatic persons, are truthfully only generated by religious-sectarian delusions and fanaticism. These signs are produced through a religious and sectarian-based psychogenic effect in the identical manner as was the case with the first famous stigmatic individual, Francis of Assisi and several hundred others.

Ptaah

This is absolutely correct. From our monitoring device I know about the incident regarding the telephone harassment by the followers of this delusional fanatic, Giorgio Bongiovanni. It seems, the religious-sectarian fanaticism knows no bounds among terrestrials.

Billy

Another question regarding the Pleiades. You mentioned previously that they are still very young. Aren't there any inhabitable planets?

Ptaah

No. Although there is a planetary formation around some of the Pleiadian celestial bodies, they are in as young a state as the stars themselves, which is only natural, of course; when the stars are young, the planets must also be young. However, on the few planets in the Pleiades star cluster no life exists whatever at this time, and the question remains, whether or not any life will ever develop there.

Billy

Thank you. Another question: For his book Geheimsache UFO ... (Secret Matter UFO ...), Michael Hesemann used a cover photo, taken by a certain Amaury Rivera, that shows an American Air Force F-14 interceptor and a UFO over Puerto Rico. Do you know anything about this?

Ptaah

Certainly. There is no doubt that trick photography was used with models suspended with fishing lines. We checked into this matter as thoroughly as we did with Ed Walters, whose photos also utilized trick photography. Michael Hesemann is an enthusiastic ufologist but he is, in this respect extremely, almost irresponsibly, gullible. He allows himself to be unusually easily tricked and deceived, and he erroneously believes that he is of extraterrestrial origin. As our very profound investigations have shown, he is a purely Earth-created individual and this may, in part, be the reason for his UFO enthusiasm and the fact that he is so easily deceived.

Billy

Regarding the falsified photos: There have been many other authentic pictures taken in the past few years by UFO observers. Among them, according to your own information, there are also photos taken by police and military personnel.

Ptaah

This is correct. A number of extraterrestrial intelligences allowed their spaceships to be sighted, filmed and photographed on Earth over the past decades. The UFO movie footage and photographic material produced worldwide, but especially in America, South America, England and other countries, does not always show actual extraterrestrial flying objects. Instead, the photos also depict exotic aircraft that have been produced by terrestrials on Earth over the past several decades, as well as craft that come from the terrestrial future, or those, which are known to us as bio-organic flying devices. They are so-called dimension changers, or life forms, that enter terrestrial air space from another dimension.

Billy

Carlos Diaz, a purported contactee, what do you think of him?

Ptaah

You pose an illogical question, for I already explained that no human beings on Earth maintain any contacts with extraterrestrial intelligences. Therefore he is a liar, fraud and cheat.

Billy

I would like to ask for additional information about the following: Are you familiar with Area 51; Roswell, the 1947 incident in New Mexico; a UFO crash in Aztec, New Mexico, similar to the one in Roswell, but a year later; a third crash at the Mexican border in '49 or '50; and, in addition, do Americans in Area 51 have some extraterrestrial corpses along with one ET whom they hold captive, and who may now be alive?

Ptaah

I have already stated several times that these matters fall under my pledge of secrecy because they are associated with government, military and national security affairs. I am not permitted, therefore, to speak about these issues officially, but I can speak to you in confidence -- under four eyes -- as you like to refer to it. Needless to say, it would indeed present a danger to you if you officially possessed such information. Let us keep things the way they are now.

Billy

That's ok, it was only a last attempt. Then back to Michael Hesemann. What do you think of him?

Ptaah

He would be a very valuable individual in disseminating the truth about our entire Mission and beyond; if only he would desist being influenced to such a great extent by lies, deceit, fraud and charlatanry, and if he were more courageous in disseminating the genuine truth instead of so much nonsense that is presented in his books and magazine.

Billy

You are expressing my opinion as well.

Ptaah

Truly, he could be a person to be accorded the required trust to disseminate Mission material, if only he would possess the courage to commit himself to it.

Billy

I know, but, unfortunately, this essential factor does not seem to exist. What about future contacts with extraterrestrials, may we speak about them now?

Ptaah

Unfortunately this remains impossible. Nonetheless, I am, or rather you are, permitted to reveal that new events will soon occur.

Billy

You mean the fact that time is fast approaching when official contacts with extraterrestrials will take place?

Ptaah

Of course. I have told you about them. In times to come, many things will occur and changes ensue with regard to extraterrestrial aircraft, their crews as well as terrestrial, mysterious and exotic-looking flying craft. Extraterrestrial contacts may be expected, but they will be completely different from the current contacts that these many lying, deceitful and fraudulent would-be contactees have portrayed them to be through their religious-sectarian absurdities and other things. Immensely significant new discoveries are also forthcoming that will take place on Earth, on the Moon, Mars and beyond, as you have previously stated and extensively revealed in your 23page report without mentioning the specific dates for particular events.

Billy

It would have been wrong to name the years or the exact days and months and so forth.

Ptaah

I have already stated that you acted correctly. Regarding this correctness, I would like to point out something that is not particularly pleasant: After observing what has been transpiring over the past years, I have noticed that only a small number of Core Group members have sufficient capabilities to write in a such a manner that they can produce their own foreordained texts and books through their individual volition and ability. This is particularly grave among the male group members, excluding Guido. The situation with various female group members is much more positive. With regard to current writings in the way of upcoming books and writings, I find the required labor-intense corrections and revisions absolutely frightful, and this applies also to the required sentence structure to achieve the appropriate wording.

Billy

Our people simply are not writers, and often they do not have the ability to write well.

Ptaah

There are at least three male group members who are convinced that their literary effusions are of unique quality. Should their works be published, however, they would require complete re-editing, proof-reading [the old German expression 'korrektiert' is used here] and revising so that they would be both stylistically correct and readable.

Billy

That's a fine mess. But tell me, from where do you know the term 'korrektieren'?

Ptaah

This is a very old, long-gone term in Old German that means something is, or must be, "put right" again.

Billy

I know this too, my friend, because I use this term all the time.

Ptaah

It is a word-merit that briefly and concisely expresses the meaning.

Billy

I am pleased that I am no longer the only one who knows and uses this term. But it seems that nowadays nobody really knows it any more - even in academic books one cannot find anything about it, as though it had never existed.

Ptaah

It is shown in our old German language records, however.

Billy

Well, this won't help me here. - And our "great authors" will be "elated" by your words.

Ptaah

It would be pointless not to speak about this fact, for the errors would never be recognized. On the other hand I would be lying if I praised them, and such actions are foreign to us. - The written works produced in the aforementioned manner truly cannot be published until they have been thoroughly re-edited.

Billy

And who is to do all this re-editing?

Ptaah

Probably you will not find the time, although you are predestined to do it. And yet, perhaps, you should not be considered for this task. I would like to suggest that Mariann does it, if she is willing; but it would take up a much of her time and would restrict her freedom. Although a few female members in the Core Group could also perform this task, they, too, have very little spare time. Therefore, we must drop this subject for now and see what can be done about it in the future.

Billy

Some prospects! Tell me now how far your research and tests have progressed regarding the latest travel and transportation technology?

Ptaah

Everything remains hampered by failures, and it will still take more time before all the functions perform flawlessly. Some additional, unexpected problems arose again recently. Once everything is functioning without defect, we will have the capability of visiting you more often as we will not have to traverse the distances to Earth and you in such an awkward manner; instead, we will do so without losing any time at all, among other things. Likewise, we have not forgotten your promised trip to visit my daughter Semjase.

Billy

I am happy to hear this. I am eager to find out when this will finally take place.

Ptaah

As it looks now it may still need some time according to your concept - perhaps two or three years.

Billy

Man, oh man, I am already old and rickety now! - One more question regarding terrestrial UFOs. You told me that you are not allowed to discuss them. Nonetheless, there are many people on our planet who openly speak about them and can even present photographic and movie-footage evidence of these craft. Even insiders now speak openly of these matters and divulge secrets.

Ptaah

That may be so, but they are not in my position. I must adhere to our directives that dictate I cannot speak about such matters. We are prohibited from interfering with any terrestrial matters other than those where we are in direct contact with you and are providing you with the information, among other things.

Billy

Of course, I should have thought of this myself. - Oh yes, what are we going to do now in future when I have questions for which I would like an answer from you?

Ptaah

We have already taken care of everything, so when something important arises we will be able to contact you telepathically. You will not have to try very hard to reach us, for the monitoring device that will remain over the Center is adjusted and programmed to receive your telepathic impulses, which are transmitted as a signal to me at several times the speed of light. I will then contact you. Likewise, I will get in contact with you when I have important information, instructions or other matters for you or the group. So, you need not struggle to call me; in other words, you need not try for hours if I am not available at that exact moment. A simple, elementary-type telepathic call will suffice and be registered by the monitoring device, whose signal is continually transmitted until I receive and confirm it. My telepathic contact with you, in turn, will ensue as rapidly as possible in normal spirit telepathy.

Billy

Thanks for your efforts. I will only call you when something really important turns up.

Ptaah

I would be much obliged. Furthermore, please refrain from asking questions that concern the interests of group members or other individuals. In the future the intent is that all of you are on your own; you must all determine, guide and handle everything by yourselves. Future questions will only be answered when they are closely or loosely related to interests in the Mission and those generated in some form by your own interests.

Billy

What about those control discs that monitor the world -- will they remain stationed around the Earth?

Ptaah

All of the monitoring devices have been removed now. The only remaining one is intended for the Center. It is no larger than 7 mm [approx. 2/8th of an inch] in diameter and 3.2 mm [1/8th inch] in thickness.

Billy

And that contains the entire monitoring electronics and the signal transmitter?

Ptaah

Along with many other devices of which you could not even dream, as you express it. The monitoring device also contains the transmitter, receiver and a related picture transmission system that transmits everything at a multiple of the speed of light to a checkpoint near to our dimension passage at the . . . star in the Pleiades star cluster. From there it reaches us by way of a dimensional transmitter located in our own space-time configuration, hence, in our dimension. For security reasons I am unauthorized to provide any further explanations.

Billy

You are probably referring to security regarding other space travelling intelligences?

Ptaah

Precisely. To provide you with more detailed information would be dangerous for us.

Billy

My friend, you are once again very laconic. - You probably feel that certain Earth visitors from other worlds beyond our solar system could obtain your information to me and then find their way into your dimension?

Ptaah

Yes, that is what I am telling you. We know of at least one such group of intelligences who are capable of entering other dimensions to the extent that they would be capable of penetrating into our dimension, which would be rather unpleasant.

Billy

I did not know that. Do these intelligences come to Earth, too?

Ptaah

Yes, they do.

Billy

Then one can understand your concerns even more. - Are you speaking of those who . . . .

Ptaah

They only visit Earth sporadically.

Billy

In the Spirit Lessons I have begun an extensive project about dream interpretation. I already explained that dream symbols throughout the Universe possess the identical value, respectively interpretation, for all human life forms, assuming of course, that the humans on other worlds receive the same symbols as us here on Earth. This is not always the case, naturally, because many other prerequisites exists on other, extraterrestrial worlds, such as in the animal kingdom, technology, landscapes, etc., etc., which have an influence on the type of symbols. If we assume, then, that on other worlds ravens exist, too, or snakes and so forth, they would possess the same symbolic value as here on Earth. Stars, fire, water, air, volcanos and thousands of other things exist throughout the entire Universe. As dream symbols, they have the same values and interpretations as those on Earth. Symbols on Earth that are non-existent here due to different types of fauna, environment, technology, music, landscapes, flora, etc., but exist on other worlds, would have the identical values on Earth or elsewhere as long as the appropriate prerequisites are given here as well. Does this apply to other Universes also? I think that it cannot be any other way.

Ptaah

Your assumptions are absolutely correct.

Billy

Then I have another question regarding . . . .

Billy

. . . . One never knows. So many unexpected things seem to happen all the time, and they could change everything.

Ptaah

This is correct, of course, and we cannot say what the future will hold in this regard. But just like you, we also hope that everything will happen as predestined.

Billy

That's easy to say, but we are really hoping for it, too. By the way - Heidi and Bob in San Diego as well as the many group members who gather around them are always very active, diligent and successful. A true joy.

Ptaah

I am well aware of the situation. Please extend to them my special greetings and high esteem, for they are truly very diligent and successful in their efforts for the Mission. They are a rare exception in America with regard to their honesty, along with their true efforts and esteem for the Mission, for you and for us. When I think of the evil schemes, fraudulent activities and exploitations perpetrated by Americans against you, I permit myself to say that the individuals in this small group around Adelheid, respectively Heidi and Bob, as well as these two themselves, belong to a very select group of people for whom you would have to search for a long, long time to find. How did you phrase it once in a parable: "Some very few, healthy, germinating seeds in a gigantic desert." A phrase I have since never forgotten.

Billy

I did say this once. That is correct. It was a very long time ago. But it actually applies to Heidi and Bob and the small group gathered around them. The Toronto Group, FIGU Japan and the few people in Sweden are also doing quite well, even though in Canada and Japan a few small snags still remain. But there is truly no comparison with Heidi's and Bob's group.

Ptaah

One must truly show them due respect.

Billy

You've said it, my friend. I wanted to ask you still about the future meditations: If you are not here any longer, does this mean you are not participating any longer either?

Ptaah

No, everything remains the same way as it has been until now. There will be no changes in this regard. Everything will continue the way it always did.

Billy

That's good, so we are not truly alone. May I ask you still something regarding the epidemics that threaten us here on Earth?

Ptaah

Present your question.

Billy

You did mention that new epidemics will also manifest themselves and spread throughout the world. When will that begin?

Ptaah

The tribulation began originally with the initial epidemics when, as usual, everything was kept covered up.

Billy

How could it be any different. Our glorious scientists also claim that certain diseases cannot cross over the species barriers such as epidemics, for example, of scrapie, also called cattle madness or BSE, and AIDS. In both cases this has already transpired, in fact a long time ago. Yet, the narrow-minded, megalomanic, moronic scientists still claim that this is impossible.

Ptaah

What you say here is absolutely correct: Pathogens of animals as well as humans are very much capable of crossing over the species barrier, mutating, and causing the infection of other species with the same disease. Pathogens have the ability to spread from one type of animal to other animal species and on to humans while, likewise, pathogens of human diseases have the ability to spread to animals. Due to the change from one species to another, the state of the disease also changes. The pathogens mutate and adapt to the other life forms. These are facts that are denied by the reprehensible, criminal and irresponsible individuals in charge. On one hand they are truly megalomanic and narrow-minded, as you said, and on the other hand, they remain so restricted in their knowledge that they fail to see the genuine correlations, or are unable to even fathom them. - Now, my friend Eduard, we should turn to other things, for we still have much to discuss.

Billy

Of course - I have no further questions.
